	abstract = {The creation of enzymes capable of catalyzing any desired chemical reaction is a grand challenge for computational protein design. Using new algorithms that rely on hashing techniques to construct active sites for multistep reactions, we designed retro-aldolases that use four different catalytic motifs to catalyze the breaking of a carbon-carbon bond in a nonnatural substrate. Of the 72 designs that were experimentally characterized, 32, spanning a range of protein folds, had detectable retro-aldolase activity. Designs that used an explicit water molecule to mediate proton shuffling were significantly more successful, with rate accelerations of up to four orders of magnitude and multiple turnovers, than those involving charged side-chain networks. The atomic accuracy of the design process was confirmed by the x-ray crystal structure of active designs embedded in two protein scaffolds, both of which were nearly superimposable on the design model.},

An automated setup is presented, which allows for the use of the method in an industrial setting. Calculations are performed for four realistic examples, retinoic acid receptor gamma, matrix metalloprotease 3, estrogen receptor alpha, and dihydrofolate reductase, focusing on different aspects of the procedure. The obtained {LIE} models are evaluated in terms of the root-mean-square {(RMS)} errors from experimental binding free energies and the ability to rank compounds appropriately. The results are compared to the best empirical scoring function, selected from a set of 10 scoring functions. In all cases, good {LIE} models can be obtained in terms of free-energy {RMS} errors, although reasonable ranking of the ligands of dihydrofolate reductase proves difficult for both the {LIE} method and scoring functions. For the other proteins, the {LIE} model results in better predictions than the best performing scoring function. These results indicate that the {LIE} approach, as a tool to evaluate docking results, can be a valuable asset in computational lead optimization programs.},

To identify subtle differences between the two forms in the highly stochastic kinetics of unfolding, we classified the unfolding trajectories using the multiple alignment method based on the analogy between the biological sequences and the molecular dynamics trajectories. A dendrogram derived from the multiple trajectory alignment revealed a clear difference in the unfolding pathways of the authentic and recombinant proteins, i.e. the former reached the transition state in an all-or-none manner while the latter unfolded less cooperatively. It was also found in the classification that the two forms of the protein shared a common transition state structure, which was in excellent agreement with the transition state structure observed experimentally in the {[Phi]-value} analysis.},

	volume = {103},
	abstract = {A new generalization of the configurational-bias Monte Carlo method is presented which avoids the problems inherent in a Boltzmann rejection scheme for sequentially generating bond bending and torsional angles. The {TraPPE-UA} (transferable potentials for phase equilibria united-atom) force field is extended to include {Lennard-Jones} interaction parameters for methine and quaternary carbon groups by fitting to critical temperatures and saturated liquid densities of branched alkanes. Configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in the Gibbs ensemble were carried out to determine the vapor-liquid coexistence curves {(VLCC)} for six alkane isomers with four to eight carbons. Results are presented for two united-atom alkane force fields: {PRF} {[Poncela,} et al. Mel. Phys. 1997, 91, 189] and {TraFPE-UA,} Standard-state specific densities for the {TraPPE-UA} model were studied by simulations in the isobaric-isothermal ensemble. It is found that a single set of methyl, methylene, methine, and quaternary carbon parameters gives a reasonable description of the fluid phases of all alkanes with two or more carbon atoms. Whereas the size of the united atoms increases with increasing number of hydrogens for the {PRF} force field, it is demonstrated here that the opposite trend yields a better fit to the experimental {VLCC} data. The {TraPPE-UA} force field underpredicts the magnitude of the experimental second virial coefficients, while {PRF} gives good second virial coefficients but does not perform satisfactorily for the {VLCC.} As is also seen for the normal alkanes, the {TraPPE-UA} force field shows small, systematic deviations from the experimental saturated vapor pressures and densities for all molecules studied, and it slightly overpredicts the critical temperatures of the larger branched alkanes.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of united atom {Lennard-Jones} model for methane, ethane, and propane in {TIP3P} water have been used to estimate the chemical potentials of aqueous methane, ethane, and propane from 600 to 1200 degrees C and densities from 0 to 1 g cm(-3). Errors in the simulation itself are negligible. Estimates of the errors in the predictions due to the inadequacy of the models show that this method of prediction gives reasonable accuracy. The calculations are not sensitive to the dipole moment of the water molecule or to the well depth (epsilon) of the water-methane interaction. The diameter (sigma) of the water-methane interaction is the most important parameter. The present predictions for methane are compared with a variety of other methods from the literature. An equation with seven adjustable parameters is presented which fits all of the simulation results as a function of temperature, density of water, and number of carbon atoms. This equation should allow reasonable extrapolations to predict the properties of butane, pentane, and hexane. An even simpler equation with only two adjustable parameters is able to fit all of the experimental data in this temperature and density region if the calculated solute-water second virial coefficient fur this model is used. The fit is not quite as accurate as with the seven-parameter equation, but this equation should be useful for predictions of normal and branched hydrocarbons, Equations of state can give good predictions which are more accurate than those of Shock et al. {(Giochem.} Cosmochim. Acta 1989, 53, 2157; 1990, 54, 915. J. Chem.

Both the activation step of the surface of the pores of the dextran polymer layer grafted on an agarose surface and the immobilization of charged ligands on the activated surface of the porous dextran polymer layer are considered. For the systems studied in this work, the activation step modifies slightly the pore structure of the base, nonactivated porous dextran polymer, while the immobilization of the ligands on the activated pore surface of the dextran layer changes significantly the pore structure of the activated dextran layer. The density distributions of the counterions and immobilized charged ligands along the direction of net transport in the adsorbent media constructed in this study are found to be nonuniform. The variables that affect the shape and magnitude of the density distributions of the counterions and immobilized charged ligands as well as the total number of charged ligands that can be immobilized on the activated porous dextran layer are identified and presented in this work. Furthermore, the data clearly show that there is local nonelectroneutrality in the porous dextran polymer ion-exchange adsorbent media, and this result has very important practical implications for the operation and performance of separation systems involving ion-exchange adsorbent media (e.g., ion-exchange chromatography systems). Also, the results of this work suggest approaches for (1) controlling the immobilization process of charged ligands and (2) constructing and studying the behavior of chromatographic polymeric monoliths and packed bed columns having a gradient of density of functionalities along the axis of the chromatographic polymeric monolith or packed bed column.},

Free energies for mutations of the {[alpha]-H} atom in p-toluic acid to six different substituents {(CH3,} Cl, {OCH3,} {CN,} {OH,} {COOH)} were calculated by a combined thermodynamic integration and perturbation method and compared to literature results from vapor pressure measurements, partition coefficients, and membrane transport experiments. Convergence of the calculated free energies was indicated by substantial declines in standard deviations for the calculated free energies with increased simulation length, by the independence of the ensemble-averaged Boltzmann factors to simulation length, and the weak dependence of hysteresis effects on simulation length over two different simulation lengths and starting from different initial configurations. Calculated values of {[Delta]([Delta]G°)X} correlate linearly with corresponding values obtained from lipid bilayer transport experiments with a slope of 1.1 and from measurements of partition coefficients between water and hexadecane or decadiene, with slopes of 1.1 and 0.9, respectively. Van der Waals interactions between the functional group of interest and the acyl chains in the ordered chain region account for more than 95\% of the overall potential energy of interaction. These results support the view that the ordered chain region within the bilayer interior is the barrier domain for transport and that solvation interactions within this region resemble those occurring in a nonpolar hydrocarbon.},

The difference, {ΔlogP,} between {logPoct} and {logPhxd} is a measure of the hydrogen bonding potential of a molecule and is identified as a target for predictive modeling. Minimized molecular electrostatic potential {(Vmin)} was shown to be an effective predictor of the contribution of hydrogen bond acceptors to {ΔlogP.} Carbonyl oxygen atoms were found to be stronger hydrogen bond acceptors for their electrostatic potential than heteroaromatic nitrogen or oxygen bound to hypervalent sulfur or nitrogen. Values of Vmin calculated for hydrogen-bonded complexes were used to explore polarization effects.

	abstract = {Structure-based design has emerged as a new tool in medicinal chemistry. A prerequisite for this new approach is an understanding of the principles of molecular recognition in protein-ligand complexes. If the three-dimensional structure of a given protein is known, this information can be directly exploited for the retrieval and design of new ligands. Structure-based ligand design is an iterative approach. First of all, it requires the crystal structure or a model derived from the crystal structure of a closely related homolog of the target protein, preferentially complexed with a ligand. This complex unravels the binding mode and conformation of a ligand under investigation and indicates the essential aspects determining its binding affinity. It is then used to generate new ideas about ways of improving an existing ligand or of developing new alternative bonding skeletons. Computational methods supplemented by molecular graphics are applied to assist this step of hypothesis generation. The features of the protein binding pocket can be translated into queries used for virtual computer screening of large compound libraries or to design novel ligands de novo. These initial proposals must be confirmed experimentally. Subsequently they are optimized toward higher affinity and better selectivity. The latter aspect is of utmost importance in defining and controlling the pharmacological profile of a ligand. A prerequisite to tailoring selectivity by rational design is a detailed understanding of molecular parameters determining selectivity. Taking examples from current drug development programs {(HIV} proteinase, {t-RNA} transglycosylase, thymidylate synthase, thrombin and, related serine proteinases), we describe recent advances in lead discovery via computer screening, iterative design, and understanding of selectivity discrimination.},

We extend the global correlation concept, to calculate the reorientational correlation on pieces of trajectories of individual probe molecules in equivalent local environments. It shows that, as experimental results indicate, local water structures exist around acetonitrile molecules in a water-acetonitrile system and are conserved in water-rich domains of a polyacrylamide {(PAA)-hydrogel-acetonitrile} system. Over and above that, local structures exist in water-poor regions of the {PAA-hydrogel,} where the dynamics of acetonitrile probe molecules slow down. An understanding at the atomic level of the variation in dynamics of acetonitrile in {PAA-hydrogel} is given. The averaged reorientational time over all time origins and all acetonitrile molecules in the simulation system reveals very good agreement with Raman spectroscopical data.},

	abstract = {The octanol/water partition coefficient {(Kow)} for organic compounds is widely used in predictive environmental studies. A significant proportion of contaminants of surface and ground water are ionisable (e.g. many pesticides, pharmaceuticals, metabolites). Such compounds may be partially ionised dependent on the {pH.} Since the neutral and ionic species exhibit different polarities, the Kow value of ionisable pesticides is {pH} dependent. It is therefore essential to determine Kow values over the full range of {pH} that occurs in the environment in order to get appropriate predictors. Numerous methods are available to measure lipophilicity but only a few are appropriate for ionisable pesticides (e.g. {pH} metric and filter probe methods). Parameters such as {pH} and ionic strength need to be carefully controlled when working with ionisable compounds. Variation of these factors probably explains why literature can yield Kow values that differ by more than one order of magnitude for some compounds. In this article, Kow values obtained for six acidic pesticides with three different methods are compared as well (data from the literature, measured by {pH} metric method and calculated with five computer programs). The values used in predictive regression equations needs to be either measured with a suitable method or selected from the literature with great care.

In this way, kinetic data (like the rate constants and the transition path ensemble) and the underlying free-energy landscape (or probability distribution) of the system are obtained efficiently and concurrently. The applicability of these techniques is illustrated by studying several test systems, including two that involve potential energy surfaces having multiple metastable states and transition pathways, representative of complex kinetic behavior.},

	abstract = {It is widely accepted that the binding constant of a receptor and ligand can be written as a two-body integral involving the interaction energy of the receptor and the ligand. Interestingly, however, three different theories of binding in the literature dictate three distinct integrals. The present study uses theory, as well as simulations of binding experiments, to test the validity of the three integrals. When binding is measured by a signal that detects the ligand in the binding site, the most accurate results are obtained by an integral of the Boltzmann factor, where the bound complex is defined in terms of an exclusive binding region. A novel prediction of this approach, that expanding a ligand can increase its binding constant, is borne out by the simulations. The simulations also show that abnormal binding isotherms can be obtained when the region over which the signal is detected deviates markedly from the exclusion zone. Interestingly, the binding constant measured by equilibrium dialysis, rather than by monitoring a localized signal, can yield a binding constant that differs from that obtained from a signal measurement, and that is matched best by the integral of the Mayer factor.},

	abstract = {Human serum albumin {(HSA)} has seven common fatty acid {(FA)} binding sites. In this study, we used the molecular mechanics {Poisson-Boltzmann} surface area method to identify high affinity {FA} binding sites on {HSA} in terms of binding free energy. Using multiple {HSA-FA} (myristate, palmitate) complex models constructed by molecular dynamics simulations, two methods were performed in molecular mechanics {Poisson-Boltzmann} surface area, the "three-trajectory method" and the "single-trajectory method". The former, which is less precise than the latter but may be more accurate as it includes the effects of conformational change upon binding, was used to classify high and low affinity sites. As a result, Sites 2, 4, and 5 were identified as high affinity sites for both {FAs.} The latter method, which is precise because energies are calculated from snapshots of the same trajectory for {HSA-FA} complex, was performed to compare the magnitude of binding free energy for these sites. The order of magnitude was 5 {\textgreater} 4 {\textgreater} 2, identical to that of a previous publication by others. In this way, a combination of the two methods was effectively used to identify high affinity sites. This study therefore provides an insight into the quantitative identification of high affinity {FA} binding sites on {HSA.}},

Importantly, failure to maintain adequate inhibitor levels is believed to provide an opportunity for resistance to emerge; thus, new strategies to prolong the lifetime of these drugs are needed. Toward this goal, numerous prodrug approaches have been developed, but these methods involve creating inactive precursors that require enzymatic processing. Using an alternative strategy inspired by the natural product {FK506,} we have synthetically modified an {HIV} protease inhibitor such that it acquires high affinity for the abundant, cytoplasmic chaperone, {FK506-binding} protein {(FKBP).} This modified protease inhibitor maintains activity against {HIV-1} protease {(IC} = 19 {nM)} and, additionally, it is partitioned into the cellular component of whole blood via binding to {FKBP.} Interestingly, redistribution into this protected niche reduces metabolism and improves its half-life in mice by almost 20-fold compared with the unmodified compound.

	abstract = {The dynamics of [alpha]-lactalbumin in the native and molten globule states in solution was investigated using quasielastic neutron scattering and molecular dynamics simulations. We generated 2 nanosecond molecular dynamics trajectories at 300 K of [alpha]-lactalbumin solvated in a water box in the native state, and a putative member of the ensemble of conformations of the molten globule state generated by simulation at high temperature. Overall the agreement between the measured and calculated dynamical structure factors is good. Preliminary analysis of the simulated dynamics of the molten globule state revealed a strong heterogeneity of motions along the protein backbone, with larger amplitudes in the regions of the protein that unfold, mainly the [beta]-sheet region. The results presented here demonstrate the utility of using a combination of neutron scattering measurements and molecular dynamics simulations to characterize and quantify, in a sequence-specific fashion, the differences in dynamics between the native and partially folded states of proteins on the time scale ({\textasciitilde}100 ps) and length scale (a few to tens of Å) probed by current neutron spectrometers.},

	abstract = {Free energy calculations from molecular simulations using thermodynamic integration or free energy perturbation require long simulation times to achieve sufficient precision. If entropic and enthalpic components of the free energy are desired, then the computational requirements are larger still. Here we present how parallel tempering {(PT)} Monte Carlo and weighted histogram analysis method {(WHAM)} can be used to improve the efficiency of free energy calculations. For both methods, which can be used separately or together, simulations at more than one temperature are performed. The same additional temperatures are often used to determine entropy changes. The results, for the aqueous solvation of n-butane and methane, show noticeable improvement in the precision of the free energy and entropy changes. The {PT} and {WHAM} methods can give similar error bars as conventional molecular dynamics in half the simulation time. The methods offer an efficient procedure for calculating free energy, entropy, and enthalpy changes in which free energy calculations are performed in parallel for a small number of closely spaced temperatures (for example, as here, at three temperatures: 298 K and 298 ( 15 K), and {WHAM} is used to enhance the data at each temperature.},

Additional simulations were performed for the binary mixtures of diethyl ether ethanol and acetone hexane. Excellent agreement with experimental results was found with the mean unsigned errors being less than 1\% for the critical temperatures and about 3\% (ethers) and 1\% (other) for the normal boiling temperatures. For the mixture of acetone hexane at 328.15 K, a positive pressure azeotrope was found with = 0.71 in satisfactory agreement with the experimental result of 0.64. Additionally, the structures of hydrogen-bonded aggregates were investigated for 1,2-ethanediol and 2-methoxyethan-1-ol, where the average hydrogen-bond energies were found to be about -20 and -14 {kJ} mol-1 for inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds, respectively.},

This result provides a “binless” method for estimating the potential of mean force, Φ = −β−1 ln ρ, eliminating the need to construct histograms or perform numerical thermodynamic integration. In our method, the distribution that we seek to compute is expressed as the sum of a reference distribution, ρ0(x)essentially an initial guess or estimate of ρ(x)and a correction term. While the method is valid for arbitrary ρ0, we speculate that an accurate choice of the reference distribution improves the convergence of the method. Using a model molecule, simulated both in vacuum and in solvent, we validate our proposed approach and compare its performance with the histogram and thermodynamic integration methods. We also discuss and validate an extension in which our approach is used in combination with a biasing force, meant to improve uniform sampling of the coordinate of interest.},

Such adaptations appear to be critical for potency against wild-type and a wide range of drug-resistant mutant {HIV-1} {RTs.} Exploitation of favorable components of inhibitor conformational flexibility (such as torsional flexibility about strategically located chemical bonds) can be a powerful drug design concept, especially for designing drugs that will be effective against rapidly mutating targets.},

The mechanism of the destabilization caused by this residue was investigated through the combined use of kinetic experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. Unfolding simulations for the authentic and recombinant forms at 398 K (ten trajectories of 5 ns for each form, 100 ns total) precisely reproduced the experimentally observed differences in unfolding behavior. In addition, experiments reproduced the destabilization of a mutant protein, {T38A,} faithfully as predicted by the simulations. This bidirectional verification between experiments and simulations enabled the atomically detailed description of the role of the extra methionine residue in the unfolding process.

	abstract = {The \${\textbackslash}lambda\$-dynamics simulation method was used to study the binding of 10 five-member ring heterocycle derivatives to an artificial cavity created inside cytochrome C peroxidase by mutagenesis. Application of dynamics using a multiple topology approach resulted in trapping in local minima. To extend the method to these cases, a new restraining potential was devised and added to the extended Hamiltonian. Two approximations were introduced in order to estimate the binding free energy within small simulation times using this potential: (a) The entropy terms related to the restraining potential are assumed to cancel, due to the similarity of the ligands. (b) The restraining potential calculated from the coordinates of the environmental atoms during a -dynamics simulation is assumed to be equal to that of the average coordinates. Relatively short -dynamics simulations with this restraining potential successfully yielded reasonable estimates of the binding affinity of the ligands as compared with both experimental data and free energy perturbation calculations. Long time -dynamics simulations with a ten-ligand system revealed that better ligands tend to have small statistical errors, which is appropriate for screening out the plausible ligands from all candidates. Furthermore, short time \${\textbackslash}lambda\$-dynamics simulations with ten identical ligands demonstrated that sufficient precision was achieved for putative discovery of tight binding ligands or guests.},

This theory involves (usually hidden) assumptions about what constitutes the bound species, {AB,} and where the contribution of the solvent appears. We present here an alternative derivation that can be traced back to Bjerrum, in which the expectation value of {K\_AB} is obtained directly through the statistical mechanical method of evaluating its ensemble {(Boltzmann-weighted)} average. The generalized Bjerrum approach more clearly delineates: (i) the different contributions to binding; (ii) the origin of the much-discussed and somewhat controversial association entropy term; and (iii) where the solvent contribution appears. This approach also allows approximations required for practical evaluation of the binding constant in complex macromolecular systems, to be introduced in a well defined way. We provide an example, with application to test cases that illustrate a range of binding behavior.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to provide a systematic discussion based on our experimental results both previously published and unpublished, to promote better understanding of volume-phase transitions in polyelectrolyte gels. Special attention was paid to the distribution of network charges as well as to the attractive interaction among polymer segments. From looking at how these effects appear in the swelling curves, an exploration of the nature of polyelectrolyte gel transitions was attempted . Two sorts of polyelectrolyte gels, temperature-responsive ionic gels based on N-isopropylacrylamide {(NIPA)} and cationic poly(ethyleneimine) {(PEI)} gels, were mainly employed with various modifications. The charge inhomogeneity within the gel phase was created by surfactant binding, immobilized enzyme reaction and physical entrapment of polyions. The attractive interactions holding the gel in a collapsed state were studied in comparison with phase separations of the corresponding linear polyelectrolyte. The main conclusions are summarized as follows:  (i) The charge inhomogeneity exhibits a large influence on the volume transition in ionic gels. (ii) Hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic association, other than electrostatic attraction, can be considered to play an important role in the segmental association. (iii) Stably associated segments via one or more of these attractive interactions causes a large hysteresis in the swelling process, in which the repulsive interaction among the fixed charges on the network is dominant as shown in the Katchalsky's model. (iv) A distribution of “neutral but hydrophilic” moieties (e.g., ion pair or salt-linkage formed between the opposite charged groups) within the gel shows a marked effect on the temperature-induced volume collapse, the aspect of which is similar to that observed in the gels with a charge inhomogeneity.},

	abstract = {Influenza A viruses cause a highly contagious respiratory disease in humans and are responsible for periodic widespread epidemics with high mortality rates. The influenza A virus {NS1} protein {(NS1A)} plays a key role in countering host antiviral defense and in virulence. The 73-residue N-terminal domain of {NS1A} {(NS1A-(1-73))} forms a symmetric homodimer with a unique six-helical chain fold. It binds canonical A-form double-stranded {RNA} {(dsRNA).} Mutational inactivation of this {dsRNA} binding activity of {NS1A} highly attenuates virus replication. Here, we have characterized the unique structural features of the {dsRNA} binding surface of {NS1A-(1-73)} using {NMR} methods and describe the {2.1-A} x-ray crystal structure of the corresponding {dsRNA} binding domain from human influenza B virus {NS1B-(15-93).} These results identify conserved {dsRNA} binding surfaces on both {NS1A-(1-73)} and {NS1B-(15-93)} that are very different from those indicated in earlier "working models" of the complex between {dsRNA} and {NS1A-(1-73).} The combined {NMR} and crystallographic data reveal highly conserved surface tracks of basic and hydrophilic residues that interact with {dsRNA.} These tracks are structurally complementary to the polyphosphate backbone conformation of A-form {dsRNA} and run at an [{\textasciitilde}]45{degrees} angle relative to the axes of helices {alpha}2/{alpha}2'. At the center of this {dsRNA} binding epitope, and common to {NS1} proteins from influenza A and B viruses, is a deep pocket that includes both hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids. This pocket provides a target on the surface of the {NS1} protein that is potentially suitable for the development of antiviral drugs targeting both influenza A and B viruses.},

Systematic sampling of fragment−protein interactions in translational and rotational space is followed by de novo assembly of fragments into molecules and computation of binding free energies for the molecules with statistical mechanics. The rigorous sampling provides independence from the choice of initial binding pose and assembling fragments enables evaluation of binding of a large number of molecule poses with relatively little computation. The method allows a full sampling of possible conformations and avoids the “conformational focusing” problem associated with free energy methods that sample only limited conformational and orientation changes from a starting pose. The direct computation of the entropy loss upon assembling fragments into molecules is an innovation for fragment-based methods. The computed binding free energies are compared to calorimetric data for a series of ligands for the T4 lysozyme {L99A} mutant and binding constants for a series of p38 {MAP} kinase ligands. In both cases, the standard error of prediction is close to 1 kcal/mol.},

These rates can be measured by one-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance and used to determine the thermodynamic parameters of global unfolding at mild solution conditions well below the melting transition. The free energy for global unfolding measured by hydrogen exchange can differ from values found by standard denaturation methods, most notably due to the slow cis-trans isomerization of the prolyl peptide bond. This difference can be quantitatively calculated from basic principles. Even with these corrections, {HX} experiments at low denaturant concentration measure a free energy of protein stability that rises above the usual linear extrapolation from denaturation data, as predicted by the denaturant binding model of Tanford. © 1994 {Wiley-Liss,} Inc.},

	abstract = {One of the predictions of the energy landscape theory of protein folding is the possibility of barrierless, "downhill" folding under certain conditions. The protein {1BBL} has been proposed to fold by such a downhill mechanism, though this is a matter of some dispute. We carried out extensive replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations on 1 {BBL} in explicit solvent to address this controversy and provide a microscopic picture of its folding thermodynamics. Our simulations show two distinct structural transitions in the folding of {1BBL.} A low-temperature transition involves a disordering of the protein's tertiary structure without loss of secondary structure. A distinct, higher temperature transition involves the complete loss of secondary structure and dissolution of the hydrophobic core. In contrast, control simulations of the {1BBL} homolog {E3BD} show a single high temperature unfolding transition. Further simulations of {1BBL} at high ionic strength show a significant destabilization of helix 11 but not helix 1, suggesting that the apparent folding cooperativity of {1BBL} may be highly dependent on experimental conditions. Although our simulations cannot provide definitive evidence of downhill folding in 1 {BBL,} they clearly show evidence of a complex, non-two-state folding process.},

	volume = {100},
	doi = {10.1063/1.466667},
	abstract = {Various methods are compared for calculating the constraint free energy in simulations with change of bond lengths. Bond forces can be evaluated as restraint forces with the use of flexible bonds, and also, when bond lengths are held fixed, as constraint forces calculated either from {SHAKE} displacements, or else from Gauss' principle of least constraint, and these forces can then be used to calculate the potential of mean force or free energy for the bond length changes. An alternative is to use so-called mean-potential forces. Analysis of the equations derived from Gauss' principle shows that the constraint force (and also the restraint force) contain a “dynamic” term, that depends on the molecular motion and for simple molecules averages to 2 {kT/r,} where r is the bond length. Integration of this term, which is not present with use of the mean-potential force, or in a Monte Carlo simulation, gives a free energy that corresponds to the change in conformational entropy of two particles maintained at a certain distance, when this distance is changed. It is unnecessary to compute this free energy term by simulation, as was done in earlier work. The accuracy and precision of these methods, and of methods in which the bond lengths do not change, are tested in a series of model calculations of increasing complexity. First, the equivalence of these methods is tested in a model system with small molecules whose motion is maintained by Brownian dynamics, and which can be subjected to very simple external forces, in order to permit very long {simulations.Second,} a comparison is made of techniques for calculating free energy change with and without change of bond lengths, applied to the transformation of ethane into ethanol in water. A third test system is the conversion of an alanine residue into a serine residue in an alpha-helix in water. It is found that results are much improved if the “vanishing” atoms (in this case hydroxyl O and H) are coupled to a heat bath via Brownian forces. Statistical errors are estimated from four successive slow-growth simulation cycles. Calculations with twofold change of {C-O} and {O-H} bond lengths and linear coupling of the nonbonded energy terms are more precise than calculations without change of bond lengths and nonlinear coupling. The free energy change for the system with flexible bonds contains a significant contribution (circa 3 {kJ} mol) from elongation of the bond lengths as a result of interaction of the polar {OH} group with water. The constraint forces calculated from the {SHAKE} displacements and from Gauss' principle turn out to be almost identical. The three methods for calculating the constraint forces achieve similar precision in the ethane/ethanol system as well as in the alpha-helix system. We also discuss the application of free energy calculations with changing bond lengths to changes of a molecule's chemistry in the middle of a chain.},

These loads were compared to the annual sales upstream of Lobith. This mass balance approach shows that substantial fractions (1.1\% to 70.4\%) of the 20 most frequently observed pharmaceuticals sold in the Rhine catchment area are recovered in the Rhine at Lobith. The observed annual loads were compared to loads predicted from annual sales in the catchment area, excreted fractions by humans and removal by waste water treatment. Observed and predicted annual loads were rather similar. The difference of the loads obtained from monitoring data and estimated from consumption was smaller than a factor of seven and did not exceed a factor of two for 15 out of the 20 pharmaceuticals. This illustrates the potential of using sales data for the prediction of concentrations in the aqueous environment.},

Despite these s imilarities, L-685,818 is a potent antagonist of both the immunosuppressive and toxic effects of the drug. Here, we present a structural analysis of this problem. Although {FK-506} and L-685,818 differ greatly in pharmacology, we have found that the three-d imensional structures of their complexes with {FKBP12} are essentially identical. Approximately half of each ligand is in contact with the receptor protein, and half is exposed to solvent; the exposed region includes the two sites where the compounds differ . These results indicate that the profound differences in the pharmacology of these two compounds are not caused by any difference in their interaction with {FKBP12.} Rather, these effects arise because relatively minor changes in the exposed part of a boun d ligand have a strong effect on how {FKBP12-ligand} complexes interact with calcineurin, their putative intracellular target. In addition, {FK-506} complexes with {FKBP12} proteins from several species all inhibit mammalian calcineurin. Analysis of the three-d imensional structure of the complex with respect to residues conserved among these proteins suggests a small number of surface residues near the bound ligands that may play a critical role in interactions between the protein-drug complex and calcineurin.},

Recently, Boger and co-workers reported a potent, selective, and efficacious class of reversible -ketoheterocycle inhibitors of {FAAH} that produce analgesia in animal models {(J.} Med. Chem. 2005, 48, 1849-1856; Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2005, 15, 1423-1428). Key aspects of the structure-activity data are addressed here through computational analysis of {FAAH} inhibition using Monte Carlo {(MC)} simulations in conjunction with free energy perturbation {(FEP)} calculations. The {MC/FEP} simulations demonstrate that incorporation of pyridine at the C5 position of the 2-keto-oxazole and 2-keto-1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives significantly enhances binding affinity by formation of a hydrogen-bonded array between the pyridyl nitrogen and Lys142 and Thr236. The results also attribute the activity boost upon substitution of oxazole by oxadiazole to reduced steric interactions in the active site and a lower torsional energy penalty upon binding.},

	abstract = {The 1-octanol/water partition coefficient is an important thermodynamic variable usually employed to understand and quantify the partitioning of solutes between aqueous and organic phases. It finds widespread use in many empirical correlations to evaluate the environmental fate of pollutants as well as in the design of pharmaceuticals. The experimental evaluation of 1-octanol/water partition coefficients is an expensive and time-consuming procedure, and thus, theoretical estimation methods are needed, particularly when a physical sample of the solute may not yet be available, such as in pharmaceutical screening. {1-Octanol/water} partition coefficients can be obtained from Gibbs free energies of solvation of the solute in both the aqueous and the octanol phases. The accurate evaluation of free energy differences remains today a challenging problem in computational chemistry. In order to study the absolute solvation Gibbs free energies in 1-octanol, a solvent that can mimic many properties of important biological systems, free energy calculations for n-alkanes in the range {C1−C8} were performed using molecular simulation techniques, following the thermodynamic integration approach. In the first part of this paper, we test different force fields by evaluating their performance in reproducing pure 1-octanol properties. It is concluded that all-atom force fields can provide good accuracy but at the cost of a higher computational time compared to that of the united-atom force fields. Recent versions of united-atom force fields, such as Gromos and {TraPPE,} provide satisfactory results and are, thus, useful alternatives to the more expensive all-atom models. In the second part of the paper, the Gibbs free energy of solvation in 1-octanol is calculated for several n-alkanes using three force fields to describe the solutes, namely Gromos, {TraPPE,} and {OPLS-AA.} Generally, the results obtained are in excellent agreement with the available experimental data and are of similar accuracy to commonly used {QSPR} models. Moreover, we have estimated the Gibbs free energy of hydration for the different compounds with the three force fields, reaching average deviations from experimental data of less than 0.2 kcal/mol for the case of the Gromos force field. Finally, we systematically compare different strategies to obtain the 1-octanol/water partition coefficient from the simulations. It is shown that a fully predictive method combining the Gromos force field in the aqueous phase and the {OPLS-AA/TraPPE} force field for the organic phase can give excellent predictions for n-alkanes up to C8 with an absolute average deviation of 0.1 log P units to the experimental data.},

Two charge states (neutral and anionic) of the drugs were simulated to understand the effect of protonation or {pH} on drug partitioning. Both drugs, irrespective of their charge state, were found to have high partition coefficients in the lipid bilayer from water. However, the values and trends of the free energy change and the location of the minima in the bilayer are seen to be influenced by the drug structure and charge state.

	abstract = {Variable selection is fundamental to high-dimensional statistical modeling, including nonparametric regression. Many approaches in use are stepwise selection procedures, which can be computationally expensive and ignore stochastic errors in the variable selection process. In this article, penalized likelihood approaches are proposed to handle these kinds of problems. The proposed methods select variables and estimate coefficients simultaneously. Hence they enable us to construct confidence intervals for estimated parameters. The proposed approaches are distinguished from others in that the penalty functions are symmetric, nonconcave on (0, infinity), and have singularities at the origin to produce sparse solutions. Furthermore, the penalty functions should be bounded by a constant to reduce bias and satisfy certain conditions to yield continuous solutions. A new algorithm is proposed for optimizing penalized likelihood functions. The proposed ideas are widely applicable. They are readily applied to a variety of parametric models such as generalized linear models and robust regression models. They can also be applied easily to nonparametric modeling by using wavelets and splines. Rates of convergence of the proposed penalized likelihood estimators are established. Furthermore, with proper choice of regularization parameters, we show that the proposed estimators perform as well as the oracle procedure in variable selection; namely, they work as well as if the correct submodel were known. Our simulation shows that the newly proposed methods compare favorably with other variable selection techniques. Furthermore. the standard error formulas are tested to be accurate enough for practical applications.},

	abstract = {Drug resistance is a significant obstacle in the effective treatment of diseases with rapidly mutating targets, such as {AIDS,} malaria, and certain forms of cancer. Such targets are remarkably efficient at exploring the space of functional mutants and at evolving to evade drug binding while still maintaining their biological role. To overcome this challenge, drug regimens must be active against potential target variants. Such a goal may be accomplished by one drug molecule that recognizes multiple variants or by a drug “cocktail”a small collection of drug molecules that collectively binds all desired variants. Ideally, one wants the smallest cocktail possible due to the potential for increased toxicity with each additional drug. Therefore, the task of designing a regimen for multiple target variants can be framed as an optimization problemfind the smallest collection of molecules that together “covers” the relevant target variants. In this work, we formulate and apply this optimization framework to theoretical model target ensembles. These results are analyzed to develop an understanding of how the physical properties of a target ensemble relate to the properties of the optimal cocktail. We focus on electrostatic variation within target ensembles, as it is one important mechanism by which drug resistance is achieved. Using integer programming, we systematically designed optimal cocktails to cover model target ensembles. We found that certain drug molecules covered much larger regions of target space than others, a phenomenon explained by theory grounded in continuum electrostatics. Molecules within optimal cocktails were often dissimilar, such that each drug was responsible for binding variants with a certain electrostatic property in common. On average, the number of molecules in the optimal cocktails correlated with the number of variants, the differences in the variants’ electrostatic properties at the binding interface, and the level of binding affinity required. We also treated cases in which a subset of target variants was to be avoided, modeling the common challenge of closely related host molecules that may be implicated in drug toxicity. Such decoys generally increased the size of the required cocktail and more often resulted in infeasible optimizations. Taken together, this work provides practical optimization methods for the design of drug cocktails and a theoretical, physics-based framework through which useful insights can be achieved.},

Clinical approval success rates were similar for oncology and other drugs, but proportionately more of the oncology failures reached expensive late-stage clinical testing before being abandoned. In relation to other drugs, new oncology drug approvals were more often first-in-class and diffused more widely across important international markets. {CONCLUSION:} The market success of oncology drugs has induced a substantial amount of investment in oncology drug development in the last decade or so. However, given the great need for further progress, the extent to which efforts to develop new oncology drugs will grow depends on future public-sector investment in basic research, developments in translational medicine, and regulatory reforms that advance drug-development science.},

	abstract = {The functions performed by proteins and nucleic acids provide the foundation for life. Chemists have recently begun to ask whether it is possible to design synthetic oligomers that approach the structural and functional complexities of these biopolymers. The study of foldamers, non-natural oligomers displaying discrete folding propensities, has demonstrated that there are several synthetic backbones that exhibit biopolymer-like conformational behavior. Early work in this area focused on oligomers comprised of a single type of monomer subunit, but recent efforts have highlighted the potential of mixed or “heterogeneous” backbones to expand the structural and functional repertoire of foldamers. In this Account, we illustrate the promise of heterogeneous backbone foldamers by focusing on examples containing both α- and β-amino acid residues. Some β-residues bear protein-like side chains, while others have cyclic structures that confer conformational rigidity. The study of heterogeneous backbone foldamers has several advantages over that of their homogeneous backbone counterparts, including access to many new molecular shapes based on variations in the stoichiometries and patterns of the subunit combinations and improved prospects for side chain diversification. Recent efforts to develop α/β-peptide foldamers can be divided into two conceptually distinct classes. The first includes entities prepared using a “block” strategy, in which α-peptide segments and β-peptide segments are combined to form a hybrid oligomer. The second class encompasses designs in which α- and β-amino acid monomers are interspersed in a regular pattern throughout an oligomer sequence. One α/β-peptide helical secondary structure, containing {CO(i)···H−N(i+4)} H-bonds analogous to those in the α-helix, has been shown via crystallography to form helix bundle quaternary structures. Desirable biological functions have been elicited from α/β-peptide foldamers. Efforts to mimic naturally occurring host-defense α-peptides have yielded new antimicrobial agents and have led to a reexamination of the long-held views regarding structure−activity relationships among these α-peptides and their analogues. Foldamers offer new platforms for mimicry of the molecular surfaces involved in specific protein−protein recognition events; recent achievements in the preparation of α/β-peptide inhibitors of the protein−protein interactions involved in apoptotic signaling (e.g., between {Bcl-xL} and pro-apoptotic partners) have revealed the benefits of employing heterogeneous backbones relative to homogeneous backbones for foldamer-based designs. These initial successes in the development of α/β-peptides exhibiting specific biological activities highlight the potential of heterogeneous backbone foldamers for use in biomedical applications and provide guidelines for future studies into new target functions.},

tautomeric propensities of whole molecules in a crystalline environment was examined. A Polarisable Continuum Model was used

of tautomers were compared to relative abundances within the Cambridge Structural Database {(CSD)} and the Protein Data Bank
{(PDB).} The work was focussed on 84 annular tautomeric forms of 34 common ring systems. Good agreement was found between the
calculations and the experimental data even if the quantity of these data was limited in many cases. The {QM} results were compared
to those produced by much faster semiempirical calculations. In a search for other sources of the useful experimental data,
the relative numbers of known compounds in which prototropic positions were often substituted by heavy atoms were also analysed.
A scheme which groups all annular tautomeric transformations into 10 classes was developed. The scheme was designed to encompass
a comprehensive set of known and theoretically possible tautomeric ring systems generated as part of a previous study. General
trends across analogous ring systems were detected as a result. The calculations and statistics collected on crystallographic

	abstract = {Hydration of protein cavities influences protein stability, dynamics, and function. Protein active sites usually contain water molecules that, upon ligand binding, are either displaced into bulk solvent or retained to mediate protein-ligand interactions. The contribution of water molecules to ligand binding must be accounted for to compute accurate values of binding affinities. This requires estimation of the extent of hydration of the binding site. However, it is often difficult to identify the water molecules involved in the binding process when ligands bind on the surface of a protein. Cytochrome P450cam is, therefore, an ideal model system because its substrate binds in a buried active site, displacing partially disordered solvent, and the protein is well characterized experimentally. We calculated the free energy differences for having five to eight water molecules in the active site cavity of the unliganded enzyme from molecular dynamics simulations by thermodynamic integration employing a three-stage perturbation scheme. The computed free energy differences between the hydration states are small (within 12 {kJ} mol-1) but distinct. Consistent with the crystallographic determination and studies employing hydrostatic pressure, we calculated that, although ten water molecules could in principle occupy the volume of the active site, occupation by five to six water molecules is thermodynamically most favorable.

One particularly exciting approach is time-resolved electronic circular dichroism {(CD)} spectroscopy, which offers resolution on a nanosecond (or faster) time scale, although it does not provide the spatial resolution of techniques like X-ray crystallography or {NMR.} The thrust of our work is to underpin fast time scale spec- troscopic studies of protein folding with a stronger theoretical foundation. Ultimately, we seek to use molecular dynamics simulations to study the influence of conformational dynamics and conformational transitions on the electronic {CD} spectra of proteins.

	abstract = {Polyelectrolyte gels with hydrophobic backbones exhibit complex phase behavior, such as the formation of various nanophases, that involves local segregation of the monomers. The formation of these inhomogeneous phases is mainly the consequence of the possible interactions on different length scales in the system, with electrostatic effects dominating over large length scales. In this work, we demonstrate the formation of nanophases in a model for a system of salt-free gel that incorporates entropic, elastic, electrostatic as well as solvent interactions. In particular, we analyze the system using both linear and nonlinear methods. Whereas the linear approximation properly identifies the region of instability against nanophase formation, it does not properly describe such nonlinear effects as the formation of very sharp interfaces between the nanosegregated regions. We further investigate the periodicity dependence as well as monomer and charge distributions for the gel as functions of different physical system parameters. Consequently, we determine that the range of solvent quality for nanophase segregation increases with increasing charge fraction and decreasing cross-link density.},

Computer-aided drug design methods have become value-adding disciplines that now contribute to the early stage of the drug discovery process [1, 2]. Computational methods encompass all aspects of drug discovery from target assessment to lead optimization. The computational strategy varies from case to case and can be influenced by several situational variables: lead hunting or lead optimization, requirement for a novel lead class, type of biological assay, structural information available, known classes of ligands, allocated chemistry resources. Today, drug discovery is still a complex and approximate science. Thus, incorporating knowledge-based approaches like ligand-based screenings may bias the process towards success. This review describes these strategies with practical applications and presents future perspectives of ligand-based screening.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel fuzzy logic controller, called
linguistic hedge fuzzy logic controller, to simplify the membership
function constructions and the rule developments. The design methodology
of linguistic hedge fuzzy logic controller is a hybrid model based on
the concepts of the linguistic hedges and the genetic algorithms. The
linguistic hedge operators are used to adjust the shape of the system
membership functions dynamically, and ran speed up the control result to
fit the system demand. The genetic algorithms are adopted to search the
optimal linguistic hedge combination in the linguistic hedge module,
According to the proposed methodology, the linguistic hedge fuzzy logic
controller has the following advantages: 1) it needs only the
simple-shape membership functions rather than the carefully designed
ones for characterizing the related variables; 2) it is sufficient to
adopt a fewer number of rules for inference; 3) the rules are developed
intuitionally without heavily depending on the endeavor of experts; 4)
the linguistic hedge module associated with the genetic algorithm
enables it to be adaptive; 5) it performs better than the conventional
fuzzy logic controllers do; and 6) it can be realized with low design
complexity and small hardware overhead. Furthermore, the proposed
approach has been applied to design three well-known nonlinear systems.
The simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
this design,},

The application of this method leads to a broad energy distribution in a large energy range and a quickly converged sampling of molecular configurations. In the second stage of simulations, the configuration space of the system is divided into a number of small regions according to preselected collective coordinates.

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations were performed in order to study the transport and adsorption of a charged macromolecule (desmopressin) onto a charged solid surface in an electrolytic solution. The strong Coulombic interaction from the charged solid surface represents the major force for accelerating, orienting, entrapping in the electrical double layer, and adsorbing the macromolecule onto the charged solid surface. The macromolecule is flattened as it approaches the charged surface, giving rise to a stronger surface exclusion effect that shields surface sites. When adsorbed, the macromolecule is restrained by a surface interaction more than one hundred times stronger than the thermal energy, of which 99.8\% results from the strong dominant Coulombic interaction, and trapped by a hydration layer adjacent to the surface. This leads to zero lateral displacement of the adsorbed macromolecule and indicates that surface diffusion is a physically implausible mechanism in similar systems. Explicit solvent is required for realistic representation of the macromolecular structure and the surface interaction energy. The adsorbed macromolecule also decreased the electrostatic potential gradient perpendicular to the charged solid surface and introduced additional electrostatic potential gradients laterally. The results obtained from the molecular dynamics simulations confirm the importance of electrophoretic migration and support the physical mechanisms used in a macroscopic continuum model that predicts an overshoot in the concentration of a charged macromolecule in the adsorbed phase under certain conditions of {pH} and ionic strength.},

	abstract = {The phenomenon of polymorphism, the ability of a molecule to adopt more than one crystal structure, is a well-established property of crystalline solids. The possible variations in physical properties between polymorphs make the reliable reproduction of a crystalline form essential for all research using organic materials, as well as quality control in manufacture. Thus, the last two decades have seen both an increase in interest in polymorphism and the availability of the computer power needed to make the computational prediction of organic crystal structures a practical possibility. In the past decade, researchers have made considerable improvements in the theoretical basis for calculating the sets of structures that are within the energy range of possible polymorphism, called crystal energy landscapes. It is common to find that a molecule has a wide variety of ways of packing with lattice energy within a few kilojoules per mole of the most stable structure. However, as we develop methods to search for and characterize “all” solid forms, it is also now usual for polymorphs and solvates to be found. Thus, the computed crystal energy landscape reflects and to an increasing extent “predicts” the emerging complexity of the solid state observed for many organic molecules. This Account will discuss the ways in which the calculation of the crystal energy landscape of a molecule can be used as a complementary technique to solid form screening for polymorphs. Current methods can predict the known crystal structure, even under “blind test” conditions, but such successes are generally restricted to those structures that are the most stable over a wide range of thermodynamic conditions. The other low-energy structures can be alternative polymorphs, which have sometimes been found in later experimental studies. Examining the computed structures reveals the various compromises between close packing, hydrogen bonding, and π−π stacking that can result in energetically feasible structures. Indeed, we have observed that systems with many almost equi-energetic structures that contain a common interchangeable motif correlate with a tendency to disorder and problems with control of the crystallization product. Thus, contrasting the computed crystal energy landscape with the known crystal structures of a given molecule provides a valuable complement to solid form screening, and the examination of the low-energy structures often leads to a rationalization of the forms found.},

To study and understand the behavior of such systems, the {M3B} model is modified and used in molecular dynamics {(MD)} simulation studies to construct porous dextran layers on the surface of a base matrix, where the dextran polymer chains and the surface are covered by water. Two different porous polymer layers having 25 and 40 monomers per main polymer chain of dextran, respectively, are constructed, and their three-dimensional {(3D)} porous structures are characterized with respect to porosity, pore size distribution, and number of conducting pathways along the direction of net transport. It is found that the more desirable practical implications with respect to structural properties exhibited by the porous polymer layer having 40 monomers per main polymer chain, are mainly due to the higher flexibility of the polymer chains of this system, especially in the upper region of the porous structure. The characterization and analysis of the porous structures have suggested a useful definition for the physical meaning and implications of the pore connectivity of a real porous medium that is significantly different than the artificial physical meaning associated with the pore connectivity parameter employed in pore network models and whose physical limitations are discussed; furthermore, the methodology developed for the characterization of the three-dimensional structures of real porous media could be used to analyze the experimental data obtained from high-resolution noninvasive three-dimensional methods like high-resolution optical microscopy. The {MD} modeling and simulations methodology presented here could be used, considering that the type and size of affinity group/ligand as well as the size of the biomolecule to be adsorbed onto the affinity group/ligand are known, to construct different porous dextran layers by varying the length of the polymeric chain of dextran, the number of attachment points to the base matrix, the degree of side branching, and the number of main polymeric chains immobilized per unit surface area of base matrix. After the characterization of the porous structures of the different porous dextran layers is performed, then only a few promising structures would be selected for studying the immobilization of adsorption sites on the pore surfaces and the subsequent adsorption of the bioactive molecules onto the immobilized affinity groups/ligands.},

The collapse pathways from a good solvent state to a poor solvent state are found to be independent of hydrodynamic interactions. On the other hand, hydrodynamic interaction is found to speed up the collapse rate. At a large quench depth (the depth of the {Lennard-Jones} potential), independent of the presence of hydrodynamic interaction, polymer molecules are found to be trapped in metastable states for long periods before acquiring their native globular state.

Although the {NNRTIs} target {HIV-1} {RT,} they are clearly different from the nucleoside {RT} inhibitors {(NRTIs).} They are highly selective for {HIV-1} and do not inhibit {HIV-2} or any other (retro)virus. They target {HIV-1} {RT} by a direct interaction without the need to be metabolised by cellular enzymes, and they interact at a site on the {HIV-1} {RT} that is near to, but distant from, the substrate-binding site. The majority of {NNRTIs} share common conformational properties and structural features that let them fit in a hydrophobic pocket at the {HIV-1} {RT,} which is nowadays well-characterized. A wide variety of crystal structures of {RT} complexed with {NNRTIs} have been obtained. They provide detailed insights in the molecular interaction of the {NNRTIs} with the amino acids lining the pocket in {HIV-1} {RT.} Due to their unprecedented specificity, the {NNRTIs} are relatively non-toxic in cell culture, and the most potent compounds reach selectivity indices that exceed 100,000 or more. However, inherent to their high specificity, the {NNRTIs} easily select for mutant virus strains with several degrees of drug resistance. The first-generation {NNRTIs} such as nevirapine and delavirdine easily loose their inhibitory potential against mutant virus strains that contain single amino acid mutations in their {RT.} The second-generation {NNRTIs} such as efavirenz, capravirine and dapivirine usually require two or more mutations in the {HIV-1} {RT} before significantly decreasing their antiviral potency. Evidently, it requires a markedly longer time period to obtain significant resistance against second-generation {NNRTIs.} The resistance spectrum of {NNRTIs} is entirely different from the {NRTI} resistance spectrum, and, as a rule, {NRTI-resistant} mutant virus strains keep full sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of {NNRTIs,} and vice versa {NNRTI-resistant} and mutant virus strains keep full sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of {NRTIs.} {NNRTIs} have proven beneficial when included in drug combination (triple or quadruple) therapy, preferably in the presence of protease inhibitors and {NRTIs.} {[ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR]}},

Another analysis based on the energy distributions of a replica pair is presented, and an exact expression for the trial-move acceptance probability in terms of the overlap of these distributions is derived. A more detailed expression is presented using an approximation of constant heat capacity, and an asymptotic form for this result, good for large system sizes, is reported. The detailed analyses are in quantitative agreement with the simulation data. It is further shown that treatment of the energy distributions as Gaussians is an inappropriate way to analyze the acceptance probability. {(C)} 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {We explored the possibility of improving the accuracy and precision of free-energy differences estimated via expanded ensembles by manipulation of the biasing weights. Three different weighing approaches were compared: the flat histogram {(FH)} method, the optimized ensemble {(OE)} method, and a method introduced in this work, denoted {MinVar,} which aims to explicitly minimize the expected variance. The performance of these three methods was tested for the simulation of chemical potentials in systems of symmetric diblock copolymers with chain lengths of either 10 or 4 beads, and a system of one large hard sphere of diameter 10d immersed in a fluid of hard spheres of diameter d. In addition, the effect of the weighing method on the observed accuracy was investigated for different choices of macrostate staging and for both optimized and nonoptimized acceptance ratio methods for calculating free-energy differences. In the diblock copolymer systems, we found that the maximum attainable accuracy can be limited by correlations between the samples, causing the “real” observed variances to be much larger than the expected “ideal” ones. Hence, if the formal minimization of the variance, as aimed by the {MinVar} method, occurs at the expense of increasing the correlations in the data, the accuracy may actually decrease. Although maximizing the number of round trips between initial and final macrostates (as aimed by the {OE} method) was found to be directly related to data decorrelation, this only translates into increased accuracy if the correlations are the major source of errors in the free energy estimates. Finally, for the hard sphere system, we found that the {MinVar} method performs better than both the {OE} and {FH} methods even though the {MinVar} method in this case never completes a round trip, illustrating that maximizing the number of round trips for fixed computational cost does not necessarily lead to increased precision.},

	abstract = {Discrete event simulation systems {(DESS)} are widely used in many diverse areas such as computer-communication networks, flexible manufacturing systems, project evaluation and review techniques {(PERT),} and flow networks. Because of their complexity, such systems are typically analyzed via Monte Carlo simulation methods. This paper deals with optimization of complex computer simulation models involving rare events. A classic example is to find an optimal (s, S) policy in a multi-item, multicommodity inventory system, when quality standards require the backlog probability to be extremely small. Our approach is based on change of the probability measure techniques, also called likelihood ratio {(LR)} and importance sampling {(IS)} methods. Unfortunately, for arbitrary probability measures the {LR} estimators and the resulting optimal solution often tend to be unstable and may have large variances. Therefore, the choice of the corresponding importance sampling distribution and in particular its parameters in an optimal way is an important task. We consider the case where the {IS} distribution comes from the same parametric family as the original (true) one and use the stochastic counterpart method to handle simulation based optimization models. More specifically, we use a two-stage procedure: at the first stage we identify (estimate) the optimal parameter vector at the {IS} distribution, while at the second stage we estimate the optimal solution of the underlying constrained optimization problem. Particular emphasis will be placed on estimation of rare events and on integration of the associated performance function into stochastic optimization programs. Supporting numerical results are provided as well.},

	abstract = {The efficacy of {HIV-1} protease inhibition therapies is often compromised by the appearance of mutations in the protease molecule that lower the binding affinity of inhibitors while maintaining viable catalytic activity and substrate affinity. The {V82F/I84V} double mutation is located within the binding site cavity and affects all protease inhibitors in clinical use. {KNI-764,} a second-generation inhibitor currently under development, maintains significant potency against this mutation by entropically compensating for enthalpic losses, thus minimizing the loss in binding affinity. {KNI-577} differs from {ENI-764} by a single functional group critical to the inhibitor response to the protease mutation. This single difference changes the response of the two inhibitors to the mutation by one order of magnitude. Accordingly, a structural understanding of the inhibitor response will provide important guidelines for the design of inhibitors that are less susceptible to mutations conveying drug resistance. The structures of the two compounds bound to the wild type and {V82F/I84V} {HIV-1} protease have been determined by X-ray crystallography at 2.0 Angstrom resolution. The presence of two asymmetric functional groups, linked by rotatable bonds to the inhibitor scaffold, allows {KNI-764} to adapt to the mutated binding site cavity more readily than {KNI-577,} with a single asymmetric group. Both inhibitors lose about 2.5 kcal/mol in binding enthalpy when facing the drug-resistant mutant protease; however {ENI-764} gains binding entropy while {ENI-577} loses binding entropy. The gain in binding entropy by {ENI-764} accounts for its low susceptibility to the drug-resistant mutation. The heat capacity change associated with binding becomes more negative when {KNI-764} binds to the mutant protease, consistent with increased desolvation. With {KNI-577,} the opposite effect is observed. Structurally, the crystallographic B factors increase for {ENI-764} when it is bound to the drug-resistant mutant. The opposite is observed for {KNI-577.} Consistent with these observations, it appears that {KNI-764} is able to gain. binding entropy by a two-fold mechanism: it gains solvation entropy by burying itself deeper within the binding pocket and gains conformational entropy by losing interaction with the protease. {(C)} 2004 {Wiley-Liss,} Inc.},

	abstract = {Under a stretching force, the sugar ring of polysaccharide molecules switches from the chair to the boat-like or inverted chair conformation. This conformational change can be observed by stretching single polysaccharide molecules with an atomic force microscope. In those early experiments, the molecules were stretched at a constant rate while the resulting force changed over wide ranges. However, because the rings undergo force-dependent transitions, an experimental arrangement where the force is the free variable introduces an undesirable level of complexity in the results. Here we demonstrate the use of force-ramp atomic force microscopy to capture the conformational changes in single polysaccharide molecules. Force-ramp atomic force microscopy readily captures the ring transitions under conditions where the entropic elasticity of the molecule is separated from its conformational transitions, enabling a quantitative analysis of the data with a simple two-state model. This analysis directly provides the physico-chemical characteristics of the ring transitions such as the width of the energy barrier, the relative energy of the conformers, and their enthalpic elasticity. Our experiments enhance the ability of single-molecule force spectroscopy to make high-resolution measurements of the conformations of single polysaccharide molecules under a stretching force, making an important addition to polysaccharide spectroscopy.},

It is found that one set of methyl and methylene parameters is sufficient to accurately describe the fluid phases of all n-alkanes with two or more carbon atoms. Whereas other n-alkane force fields employ methyl groups that an either equal or larger in size than the methylene groups, it is demonstrated here that using a smaller methyl group yields a better fit to the set of experimental data. As should be expected from an effective pair potential, the new parameters do not reproduce experimental second virial coefficients. Saturated vapor pressures and densities show small, but systematic deviation from the experimental data.},

We find that the net difference in free energy for the two changes is 0.85 kcal/mol, with the binding of {FK506} relatively more favorable for the native protein than the mutant. This net energy compares very favorably with the experimentally measured value of 0.60 kcal/mol. The results indicate that the relatively better binding of {FK506} to the native protein is driven by the favorable entropy associated with the release of water molecules from the protein when the ligand binds. For a variety of reasons, modest size of the system, smallness of the change being examined, rapid convergence of the ensemble that needs to be determined and use of statistical estimates to control sampling, we have been able to carry out atypically reliable and reproducible free energy calculations for this protein system. Free energy changes for the two simulations {(Y82F} {FKBP-12/FK506} and {Y82F} {FKBP-12)} have been calculated a total of eight times each, to compare a variety of different methodological choices and to ensure that the results are statistically significant. Detailed analysis of the free energy results has been carried out, and indicates that even when applicable, deconvolution of the total free energy into components can be very difficult, that the statistical error estimates can give a reasonable bound on the error in a simulation, and that one must be careful to use the same simulation protocol in all simulations being compared.},

This methodology can be used to tune the binding of a ligand to a panel of potential targets and decoys, along the continuum from narrow binding to only one partner to broad binding to the entire panel. Using {HIV-1} protease as a model system, we probe specificity in three distinct ways. First, we probe interactions that could make the promiscuous protease inhibitor pepstatin more selective toward {HIV-1} protease. Next, we study clinically approved {HIV-1} protease inhibitors and probe ways to broaden the binding profiles toward both wild-type {HIV-1} protease and drug-resistant mutants. Finally, we study a conformational ensemble of wild-type {HIV-1} protease to 'design in' broad specificity to known drugs before resistance mutations arise. The results from this conformational ensemble were similar to those from the drug-resistant ensemble, suggesting the use of a conformational wild-type ensemble as a tool to develop escape-mutant-resistant inhibitors.},

	abstract = {We illustrate the application of Bennett's acceptance ratio method {(BAR)} to problems in which standard methods to compute free energy differences (thermodynamic integration, exponential formula) are not practical. Our starting point is the observation that {BAR} can often compute the free energy difference between two states without the need for intermediate states usually employed (and necessary) in alchemical free energy simulations. This is demonstrated first for the free energy difference between ethane and methanol in aqueous solution. We then show how {BAR} can be used to compute directly rather unusual free energy differences, such as the free energy difference resulting from changing the treatment of electrostatic interactions, from switching the force field, or from using an implicit solvent model. Calculations of this kind should prove useful for force field development and the validation of implicit solvent methods. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem, 2009},

	abstract = {A modified thermodynamic integration technique is presented to obtain free energy differences from molecular dynamics simulations. In this multiconfiguration thermodynamic integration technique, the commonly employed single configuration (slow growth) approximation is not made. It is shown, by analysis of the sources of error, how the multiconfiguration variant of thermodynamic integration allows for a soundly based assessment of the statistical error in the evaluated free energy difference. Since ensembles of configurations are generated for each integration step, a statistical error can be evaluated for each integration step. By generating ensembles of different lengths, the statistical error can be equally distributed over the integration. This eliminates the difficult problem in single configuration thermodynamic integrations of determining the best rate of change of the Hamiltonian, which is usually based on equally distributing the free energy change. At the same time, this procedure leads to a more efficient use of computer time by providing the possibility of added accuracy from separate calculations of the same Hamiltonian change. The technique is applied to a simple but illustrative model system consisting of a monatomic solute in aqueous solution. In a second example, a combination of multiconfiguration thermodynamic integration and thermodynamic perturbation is used to obtain the potentials of mean force for rotation of the sidechain dihedral angles for valine and threonine dipeptides with restrained backbones in aqueous solution.},

Contrast variation permits independent probing of the structure of protein−surfactant complexes with negligible scattering contributions from the polyacrylamide matrix. The conformation of the protein complexes in the gel is found to be independent of the electric fields that are applied in this work (10 V/cm). Furthermore, there are no signs of large-scale macromolecular orientation (anisotropy) in the scattering patterns. However, the scattering shows that there are significant interparticle correlations between the protein−surfactant complexes that are electrophoretically inserted into the gel. These interactions develop when the total concentration of protein in the gels reaches values that are larger than ∼1 {mg/mL.} The correlations are due to molecular crowding in the small fraction of pores that are available for protein migration.},

In this work, a cubic model of a hydrogel network was developed and an infinite hydrogel backbone network was constructed for molecular dynamics simulation. The water structure and water−polymer interaction was investigated from the radial distribution function and the viewpoint of the hydrogen-bonding system. It is found that the hydrogen bonds between polymer and water strongly depress the diffusion of water molecules and enhance the structure of water in the system. The greater the network mesh size of the polymer, the weaker the structure of the water. The decreasing of the density of hydrogen bonds between polymer and water is the major factor that leads to the weakening of water structure.},

A comparison between the folded and the unfolded ensembles reveals that, even though virtually none of the individual members of the unfolded ensemble exhibits native-like features, the mean unfolded structure (averaged over the entire unfolded ensemble) has a native-like geometry. This suggests several novel implications for protein folding and structure prediction as well as new interpretations for experiments which find structure in ensemble-averaged measurements. {(C)} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {The recently developed lambda-dynamics free-energy based simulation method was used to study the binding of 10 five-member ring heterocycle derivatives to an artificial cavity created by mutagenesis inside cytochrome c peroxidase. Application of lambda-dynamics to this system gives a reasonable estimate of the binding affinity of the ligands. This methodology also provides a means to explore the binding orientations and conformations of the ligands inside the binding pocket much better than does conventional {MD.} This is due to the scaling of forces inherent in the it-dynamics method, which lowers the barriers separating different binding modes and conformations. Examination of the lambda-dynamics trajectory of the ligands revealed alternative binding orientations and conformations not detected by crystallography. Furthermore, a lambda-dynamics simulation starting from random initial orientations, in which some li,ligands take significantly different orientations as compared with those from the X-ray structure, successfully samples the X-ray crystallographic orientations in all ligands. Ligand sampling by conventional {MD} starting from same initial structures remains trapped in the local minima from which they start. Such efficient sampling of ligand orientations and conformations is expected to diminish the limitation that an initial ligand structure must be close to its true bound orientation in order to yield a reasonable estimate of the binding free energy.},

Typically, these screening technologies are considered distinct approaches, as one is experimental and the other is theoretical in nature.

Various statistical, informatics and filtering methods have recently been introduced to foster the integration of experimental and in silico screening and maximize their output in drug discovery. Although many of these ideas and efforts have not yet proceeded much beyond the conceptual level, there are several success stories and good indications that early-stage drug discovery will benefit greatly from a more unified and knowledge-based approach to biological screening, despite the many technical advances towards even higher throughput that are made in the screening arena.},

Unfortunately, {HIV-1} develops resistance to all of the available drugs. Although a number of useful {anti-HIV} drugs have been approved for use in patients, the problems associated with drug toxicity and the development of resistance means that the search for new drugs is an ongoing process. The three viral enzymes, reverse transcriptase {(RT),} integrase {(IN),} and protease {(PR)} are all good drug targets. Two distinct types of {RT} inhibitors, both of which block the polymerase activity of {RT,} have been approved to treat {HIV-1} infections, nucleoside analogs {(NRTIs)} and nonnucleosides {(NNRTIs),} and there are promising leads for compounds that either block the {RNase} H activity or block the polymerase in other ways. A better understanding of the structure and function(s) of {RT} and of the mechanism(s) of inhibition can be used to generate better drugs; in particular, drugs that are effective against the current drug-resistant strains of {HIV-1.}},

	volume = {110},
	abstract = {The use of Ewald and related methods to handle electrostatic interactions in explicit-solvent simulations of solutions imposes an artificial periodicity on systems which are inherently nonperiodic. The consequences of this approximation should be assessed, since they may crucially affect the reliability of those computer simulations. In the present study, we propose a general method based on continuum electrostatics to investigate the nature and magnitude of periodicity-induced artifacts. As a first example, this scheme is applied to the solvation free-energy of a spherical ion. It is found that artificial periodicity reduces the magnitude of the ionic solvation free-energy, because the solvent in the periodic copies of the central unit cell is perturbed by the periodic copies of the ion, thus less available to solvate the central ion. In the limit of zero ionic radius and infinite solvent permittivity, this undersolvation can be corrected by adding the Wigner self-energy term to the solvation free-energy. For ions of a finite size or a solvent of finite permittivity, a further correction is needed. An analytical expression for this correction is derived using continuum electrostatics. As a second example, the effect of artificial periodicity on the potential of mean force for the interaction between two spherical ions is investigated. It is found that artificial periodicity results in an attractive force between ions of like charges, and a repulsive force between ions of opposite charges. The analysis of these two simple test cases reveals that two individually large terms, the periodicity-induced perturbations of the Coulomb and solvation contributions, often cancel each other significantly, resulting in an overall small perturbation. Three factors may prevent this cancellation to occur and enhance the magnitude of periodicity-induced artifacts: (i) a solvent of low dielectric permittivity, (ii) a solute cavity of non-negligible size compared to the unit cell size, and (iii) a solute bearing a large overall charge. {(C)} 1999 American Institute of Physics. {[S0021-9606(99)50104-9].}},

In addition to {Lennard-Jones} sites on carbon atoms, this model utilizes {Lennard-Jones} sites on the centers of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in the Gibbs and canonical ensembles were carried out to calculate the one-component vapor-liquid phase equilibria for methane to n-dodecane, to determine the phase diagram of supercritical ethane and n-heptane mixtures, to obtain the Gibbs free energies of transfer for n-pentane and n-hexane between helium vapor and rr-heptane liquid phases, and to study the high-pressure region of the equation of state for n-pentane and n-decane. The explicit-hydrogen representation with its more faithful description of the molecular shape of alkanes allows us to find a set of {Lennard-Jones} parameters that yields significantly better agreement with experiment for one- and multicomponent phase equilibria than our united-atom alkane model, but the price is higher computational cost.},

In principle, {TS} should also be a good target for drugs used to fight infectious disease. In practice, {TS} is highly conserved across species, and it has proven to be difficult to develop inhibitors that are selective for microbial {TS} enzymes over the human enzyme. Using the structure of {TS} from Lactobacillus casei in complex with the nonsubstrate analogue phenolphthalein, inhibitors were designed to take advantage of features of the bacterial enzyme that differ from those of the human enzyme. Upon synthesis and testing, these inhibitors were found to be up to 40-fold selective for the bacterial enzyme over the human enzyme. The crystal structures of two of these inhibitors in complex with {TS} suggested the design of further compounds. Subsequent synthesis and testing showed that these second-round compounds inhibit the bacterial enzyme at sub-micromolar concentrations, while the human enzyme was not inhibited at detectable levels (selectivities of 100-1000-fold or greater). Although these inhibitors share chemical similarities, X-ray crystal structures reveal that the analogues bind to the enzyme in substantially different orientations. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments suggest that the individual inhibitors may adopt multiple configurations in their complexes with {TS.}},

In particular, the reverse transcriptase {(RT)} inhibitors still represent the majority of the clinically used {anti-HIV} drugs and constitute the main backbone of currently employed combinatorial regimens. Highly active antiretroviral combination chemotherapy {(HAART),} combining {RT} and protease inhibitors, has proven the most effective approach to treat {HIV} disease, since it has been shown to markedly suppress viral replication and appearance of drug resistance for a relatively long period. These therapies, however, do not constitute a definitive cure, since they are not able to completely eradicate the virus from the infected individual. Beside drug toxicity problems, the emergence of drug resistance associated with the particular regimen employed further complicates the situation. This review will summarise the most recent achievements, as well as the future directions in the development of novel {anti-RT} compounds. {[ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR]}},

In particular, we describe the use of (1) acceptance ratio methods for the robust estimation of free-energy changes associated with transitions between Lambda states of the partial molecule, (2) {non-Boltzmann} sampling of the probability density of Lambda states so that one can achieve either a flat histogram or an optimized histogram based on the maximization of round trips between the Lambda bounds, and (3) an approach to select suitable intermediate stages of the Lambda parameter that maximizes such round trips. The validity of the advocated methods is demonstrated by their application to two model systems, namely, the solvation of large hard spheres into a fluid of small spheres, and the mesophase formation of a block copolymer-homopolymer mixture.},

The models exhibit the asymmetry that is sometimes seen in these calculations, in which the magnitude of the bias is greater when the calculation is performed in one direction {(A-{\textgreater}B,} sampling system A and perturbing into system B) versus the other {(B-{\textgreater}A),} Both models are formulated as a system of N independent particles, each sampling a space in the presence of a one-body field that is different for the A and B systems. In one model the field is a harmonic potential. The other model is discrete, such that each particle can be at one of two points (or states) of different energy. The neglected-tail bias model is applied to each system to estimate the average bias as a function of the amount of {FEP} sampling, and numerical calculations are performed to show that the bias model is effective. We show that the bias is significantly smaller when sampling is performed on the system having a broader work distribution (we designate this direction “insertion” ) compared to the bias for {FEP} calculations that sample the system with a narrower distribution (“deletion”)},

	abstract = {One of the major challenges raised by {HIV} chemotherapy is the insurgence of viral resistance to drugs. Resistance to antiviral therapy has been observed for each of the different classes of anti-viral drugs: nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors. The crucial question for {AIDS} drug research community is: Should we continue the search of new {anti-HIV} drugs which can overcome {HIV} resistance insurgence or should we consider resistance to {anti-HIV} drugs as a futile challenge? This review, focussed specifically on {HIV} antiprotease drugs, highlights the different strategies which have been developed to design new anti-protease drugs which could overcome {HIV} resistance, and also reviews the different classes of compounds (peptidomimetic or non-peptidomimetic) actually under investigation in order to face the problem of {HIV} resistance to drug.},

Here, we present a new implementation of our molecular simulation toolkit {GROMACS} which now both achieves extremely high performance on single processors from algorithmic optimizations and hand-coded routines and simultaneously scales very well on parallel machines. The code encompasses a minimal-communication domain decomposition algorithm, full dynamic load balancing, a state-of-the-art parallel constraint solver, and efficient virtual site algorithms that allow removal of hydrogen atom degrees of freedom to enable integration time steps up to 5 fs; for atomistic simulations also in parallel. To improve the scaling properties of the common particle mesh Ewald electrostatics algorithms, we have in addition used a {Multiple-Program,} {Multiple-Data} approach, with separate node domains responsible for direct and reciprocal space interactions. Not only does this combination of algorithms enable extremely long simulations of large systems but also it provides that simulation performance on quite modest numbers of standard cluster nodes.},

We have determined crystal structures of {Lys103Asn/Tyr181Cys} mutant {HIV-1} {RT} with and without a bound non-nucleoside inhibitor {(HBY} 097, {(S)-4-isopropoxycarbonyl-6-methoxy-3-(methylthio-methyl)-3,4-dihydroquinoxalin-2(1H)-thione)} at 3.0 Å and 2.5 Å resolution, respectively. The structure of the double mutant {RT/HBY} 097 complex shows a rearrangement of the isopropoxycarbonyl group of {HBY} 097 compared to its binding with wild-type {RT.} {HBY} 097 makes a hydrogen bond with the thiol group of Cys181 that helps the drug retain potency against the {Tyr181Cys} mutation. The structure of the unliganded double mutant {HIV-1} {RT} showed that {Lys103Asn} mutation facilitates coordination of a sodium ion with Lys101 O, Asn103 N and O[delta]1, Tyr188 O[eta], and two water molecules. The formation of the binding pocket requires the removal of the sodium ion. Although the {RT} alone and the {RT/HBY} 097 complex were crystallized in the presence of {ATP,} only the {RT} has an {ATP} coordinated with two Mn2+ at the polymerase active site. The metal coordination mimics a reaction intermediate state in which complete octahedral coordination was observed for both metal ions. Asp186 coordinates at an axial position whereas the carboxylates of Asp110 and Asp185 are in the planes of coordination of both metal ions. The structures provide evidence that {NNRTIs} restrict the flexibility of the {YMDD} loop and prevent the catalytic aspartate residues from adopting their metal-binding conformations.},

	abstract = {Abstract: We present a binding free energy function that consists of force field terms supplemented by solvation terms. We used this function to calibrate the solvation model along with the binding interaction terms in a self-consistent manner. The motivation for this approach was that the solute dielectric-constant dependence of calculated hydration gas-to-water transfer free energies is markedly different from that of binding free energies {(J.} Comput. Chem. 2003, 24, 954). Hence, we sought to calibrate directly the solvation terms in the context of a binding calculation. The five parameters of the model were systematically scanned to best reproduce the absolute binding free energies for a set of 99 protein-ligand complexes. We obtained a mean unsigned error of 1.29 kcal/mol for the predicted absolute binding affinity in a parameter space that was fairly shallow near the optimum. The lowest errors were obtained with solute dielectric values of Din = 20 or higher and scaling of the intermolecular van der Waals interaction energy by factors ranging from 0.03 to 0.15. The high apparent Din and strong van der Waals scaling may reflect the anticorrelation of the change in solvated potential energy and configurational entropy, that is, enthalpy-entropy compensation in ligand binding {(Biophys.} J. 2004, 87, 3035-3049). Five variations of preparing the protein-ligand data set were explored in order to examine the effect of energy refinement and the presence of bound water on the calculated results. We find that retaining water in the final protein structure used for calculating the binding free energy is not necessary to obtain good results; that is the continuum solvation model is sufficient. Virtual screening enrichment studies on estrogen receptor and thymidine kinase showed a good ability of the binding free energy function to recover true hits in a collection of decoys.},

	abstract = {The parallel artificial membrane permeability assay {(PAMPA)} system has promise to rapidly screen drug candidate passive permeability, but has been poorly described in terms of its lipid membrane structure and function. The objective was to investigate the role of {PAMPA} lipid composition on the permeability of five model compounds. {PAMPA} was used and employed individual phospholipids that varied in phosphate head group and acyl chain unsaturation. Transport of benzoic acid, taurocholic acid, metoprolol, sucrose, and mannitol was measured. Membrane fluidity was assessed by 1,3-diphenylhexatriene fluorescence anisotropy. Results indicate that compound permeability across {PAMPA} differed in their sensitivity to membrane lipid composition, where compounds with appreciable permeability (i.e. at least 0.2 × 10-6 cm/s) were possibly sensitive to membrane fluidity and apparent ion pair effects. Benzoic acid permeability ranged 51-fold across membrane types, suggesting acyl chain effect on membrane fluidity. Mannitol, sucrose, and taurocholic acid permeabilities were low and independent of lipid composition. Metoprolol permeability ranged 17-fold and exhibited a markedly high permeability across 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-l-serine] due to apparent ion pair-facilitated transport. Compound permeability was lowest across the phosphatidylcholines, which is consistent with phosphatidylcholine exhibiting relatively high membrane rigidity. In contrast to results from phosphatidylethanolamines and phosphatidylserines, acyl chain unsaturation had no effect on permeability across phosphatidylcholines. In conclusion, while much remains unknown about {PAMPA} structure and subsequent {PAMPA} permeability, results here from five solutes suggest that, for solutes with appreciable permeability, lipid composition modulated drug permeability through possible membrane fluidity and apparent ion pair influences.},

We have solved the three-dimensional structures of the {FKBP} complexes with two 32-indolyl derivatives of ascomycin. The structures of the protein and the macroli de are remarkably similar to those seen in the complexes with tacrolimus and ascomycin. The indole groups project away from the body of the complex, and multiple conformations are observed for the linkage to these groups as well as for a nearby peptide su ggesting apparent flexibility in these parts of the structure.

Techniques from traditional numerical analysis {(Newton-Raphson,} coarse projective integration) are thus enabled; these techniques help analyze important features of the free-energy landscape (coarse transition states, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, transition rates, etc.). Reverse integration of coarse variables backward in time can assist escape from free energy minima and trace low-dimensional free energy surfaces. To illustrate the coarse molecular dynamics approach, we combine multiple short (0.5 ps) replica simulations to map the free energy surface of the “alanine dipeptide” in water, and to determine the similar to1/(1000 ps) rate of interconversion between the two stable configurational basins corresponding to the alpha-helical and extended minima.},

	abstract = {A comparative analysis is provided of rigorous and approximate methods for calculating absolute binding affinities of two protein-ligand complexes: the {FKBP} protein bound with small molecules 4-hydroxy-2-butanone and {FK506.} Our rigorous approach is an umbrella sampling technique where a potential of mean force is determined by pulling the ligand out of the protein active site over several simulation windows. The results of this approach agree well with experimentally observed binding affinities. Also assessed is a commonly used approximate endpoint approach, which separately estimates enthalpy, solvation free energy, and entropy. We show that this endpoint approach has numerous variations, all of which are prone to critical shortcomings. For example, conventional harmonic and quasiharmonic entropy estimation procedures produce disparate results for the relatively simple protein-ligand systems studied in this work.},

Existing {OPLS-AA} torsional parameters for alkanes, alcohols, ethers, hemiacetals, esters ,and ketoamides were improved based on {MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ} and {MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ} calculations. Nonbonded parameters for the sp(3) carbon and oxygen atoms were refined using Monte Carlo simulations of bulk liquids. The resulting force field predicts conformer en ergies and torsional barriers of alkanes. alcohols, ethers, and hemiacetals with an overall {RMS} deviation of 0.40 kcal/mol as compared to reference data. Densities of 19 bulk liquids are predicted with an average error of 1.1\%. and heats of vaporization a -re reproduced within 2.4\% of experimental values. The force field was used to perform conformational analysis of smaller analogs of the macrocyclic polyketide drug {FK506.} Structures that adopted low-energy conformations similar to that of bound {FK506} wer e identified. The results show that a linker of four ketide units constitutes the shortest effector domain that allows binding of the ketide drugs to {FKBP} proteins. It is proposed that the exact chemical makeup of the effector domain has little influence on the conformational preference of tetraketides. {(C)} 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The parametrization follows the same philosophy as was used previously for lipids and proteins, focusing on the reproduction of partitioning free energies of small compounds between polar and nonpolar phases. The carbohydrate building blocks considered are the monosaccharides glucose and fructose and the disaccharides sucrose, trehalose, maltose, cellobiose, nigerose, laminarabiose, kojibiose, and sophorose. Bonded parameters for these saccharides are optimized by comparison to conformations sampled with an atomistic force field, in particular with respect to the representation of the most populated rotameric state for the glycosidic bond. Application of the new coarse-grained carbohydrate model to the oligosaccharides amylose and Curdlan shows a preservation of the main structural properties with 3 orders of magnitude more efficient sampling than the atomistic counterpart. Finally, we investigate the cryo- and anhydro-protective effect of glucose and trehalose on a lipid bilayer and find a strong decrease of the melting temperature, in good agreement with both experimental findings and atomistic simulation studies.},

Since the discovery of these molecules in the 1980s, a great deal of effort has been devoted to elucidating their mechanisms of action and to developing analogues with improved properties for possible therapeutic use. The vast majority of this effort has focused on materials composed of a single type of molecule, most commonly a peptide with a specific sequence of α-amino acid residues. We have recently shown that sequence-random nylon-3 copolymers can mimic favorable properties of host-defense peptides, and here we document structure−activity relationships in this polymer family. Although the polymers are heterogeneous in terms of subunit order and stereochemistry, these materials display structure−activity relationships comparable to those that have been documented among host-defense peptides and analogous synthetic peptides. Previously such relationships have been interpreted in terms of a specific and regular folding pattern (usually an α-helix), but our findings show that these correlations between covalent structure and biological activity do not require the adoption of a specific or regular conformation. In some cases our observations suggest alternative interpretations of results obtained with discrete peptides.},

Introduction of charged dextran polymers results in enhanced adsorption kinetics despite a dramatic reduction of the accessible pore size as determined by inverse size-exclusion chromatography. Incorporation of neutral dextran polymers in a charged agarose bead results instead in substantially lower binding capacities. The effective pore diffusivities obtained from batch uptake curves increase substantially as the protein concentration is reduced for the resins containing charged dextran grafts, but are much less dependent on protein concentration for the resins with no dextran or uncharged dextran grafts. The batch uptake results are corroborated by microscopic observations of transient adsorption in individual particles. In all cases studied, the adsorption kinetics is characterized by a sharp adsorption front consistent with a shell-progressive, diffusion limited mechanism. Greatly enhanced transport rates are obtained with an experimental resin containing charged dextran grafts with effective pore diffusivities that are 1-9 times larger than the free solution diffusivity and adsorption capacity approaching 300 mg/cm3 of particle volume.},

However, these technologies require physical samples of the substances to be tested.

Several approved anti-influenza drugs effectively target the neuraminidase {(NA),} a surface glycoprotein that cleaves terminal sialic acid residues and facilitates the release of viral progeny from infected cells. The first crystal structures of group-1 {NAs} revealed that although the binding pose of oseltamivir was similar to that seen in previous crystallographic complexes, the 150-loop adopted a distinct conformation, opening a new cavity adjacent to the active site. Here we show that the 150-loop is able to open into significantly wider conformations than seen in the crystal structures, through explicitly solvated {MD} simulations of the apo and oseltamivir-bound forms of tetrameric N1. We find that motion in the 150-loop is coupled to motion in the neighboring 430-loop, which expands the active site cavity even further. Furthermore, in simulations of the oseltamivir-bound system, the 150-loop approaches the closed conformation, suggesting that the loop switching motion may be more rapid than previously observed.},

	title = {Ewald artifacts in computer simulations of ionic solvation and ion-ion interaction: A continuum electrostatics study},
	volume = {110},
	abstract = {The use of Ewald and related methods to handle electrostatic interactions in explicit-solvent simulations of solutions imposes an artificial periodicity on systems which are inherently nonperiodic. The consequences of this approximation should be assessed, since they may crucially affect the reliability of those computer simulations. In the present study, we propose a general method based on continuum electrostatics to investigate the nature and magnitude of periodicity-induced artifacts. As a first example, this scheme is applied to the solvation free-energy of a spherical ion. It is found that artificial periodicity reduces the magnitude of the ionic solvation free-energy, because the solvent in the periodic copies of the central unit cell is perturbed by the periodic copies of the ion, thus less available to solvate the central ion. In the limit of zero ionic radius and infinite solvent permittivity, this undersolvation can be corrected by adding the Wigner self-energy term to the solvation free-energy. For ions of a finite size or a solvent of finite permittivity, a further correction is needed. An analytical expression for this correction is derived using continuum electrostatics. As a second example, the effect of artificial periodicity on the potential of mean force for the interaction between two spherical ions is investigated. It is found that artificial periodicity results in an attractive force between ions of like charges, and a repulsive force between ions of opposite charges. The analysis of these two simple test cases reveals that two individually large terms, the periodicity-induced perturbations of the Coulomb and solvation contributions, often cancel each other significantly, resulting in an overall small perturbation. Three factors may prevent this cancellation to occur and enhance the magnitude of periodicity-induced artifacts: (i) a solvent of low dielectric permittivity, (ii) a solute cavity of non-negligible size compared to the unit cell size, and (iii) a solute bearing a large overall charge. {(C)} 1999 American Institute of Physics. {[S0021-9606(99)50104-9].}},

One of fundamental issues is how to select and interpret the molecular descriptors used in both methods. In this work, we first employed support vector machine on a dataset containing 155 polar narcotics and 19 uncouplers to filter the predictive hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding descriptors. Molecular dynamics simulations were then conducted to investigate the behavior of salicylate and pentachlorophenol molecules in the context of a palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine lipid bilayer. The results demonstrated that their equilibrium properties in the lipid bilayer were closely associated with hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding descriptors. The preferable occupations of these molecules in the lipid bilayer were discussed in terms of their modes of toxic action. The observations from molecular dynamics simulations facilitated to elucidate the mechanism of polar narcotics and uncouplers. Crown Copyright {(C)} 2009 Published by Elsevier Inc.

A combination of two strategies are used: (i) to use a pathway for particle insertions that avoids large variations in free energy and (ii) to use calculated free energy derivatives to construct a bias potential that makes the pathway fairly level. Only a few very short simulations are needed to accomplish the latter, and then, a full {EE} simulation is done to obtain the chemical potential. By practical calculations of the chemical potential of benzene, cyclohexane, and benzylamine in water, it is shown that this method is at least equally efficient to the recent adaptive {EE} {(AEE)} method by â‰ˆberg et al. {(J.} Chem. Phys. 2004, 120, 3370). Furthermore, the new method provides an alternative strategy that complements existing {EE} methods.},

The setting of a solubility challenge by this journal proved an excellent opportunity to explore several different modeling methods, utilizing a supplied dataset of high-quality aqueous solubility measurements. Four contrasting approaches (simple linear regression, artificial neural networks, category formation, and available in silico models) were utilized within our laboratory and the quality of these predictions was assessed. These were chosen to span the multitude of modeling methods now in use, while also allowing for the evaluation of existing commercial solubility models. The conclusions of this study were surprising, in that a simple linear regression approach proved to be superior over more complex modeling methods. Possible explanations for this observation are discussed and also recommendations are made for future solubility prediction.},

Our findings suggest that for runs of or around ten generations' duration--as is typical in {DE--there} is little difference between the way in which {DE} needs to be configured in the high- and low-throughput regimes, nor across different degrees of landscape epistasis. In all cases, a high selection pressure (but not an extreme one) combined with a moderately high mutation rate works best, while crossover provides some benefit but only on the less rugged landscapes. These genetic algorithms were also compared with a "model-based approach" from the literature, which uses sequential fixing of the problem parameters based on fitting a linear model. Overall, we find that purely evolutionary techniques fare better than do model-based approaches across all but the smoothest landscapes.},

Relative values of ab initio minimum interaction energies and geometries between helium or neon and model compounds were used to optimize the relative magnitude of the {L-T} parameters. Absolute values of the {L-J} parameters were determined by reproducing experimental heats of vaporization and molecular volumes for pure solvents. Application of the approach was performed on methane ethane, and propane. Free energies of aqueous solvation and butane pure solvent and aqueous solvation calculations were used to test the developed {L-J} parameters. The new alkane parameters are similar or improved as compared with current empirical force field parameters with respect to experimental pure solvent properties and free energies of aqueous solvation.

	abstract = {Gas solubility in liquids is driven by favorable solute-solvent interactions while being opposed by the entropic cost of creating a molecular-sized cavity of suitable size. We have investigated these contributions to the solvation free energy of small hydrophobic solutes and studied the dependence of the entropy cost of solute insertion on solvent-solvent interactions in cosolvent/water mixtures by means of molecular dynamics simulations. The cosolvents acetone, dimethyl sulfoxide, and sodium chloride were studied. Acetone, which weakly interacts with water relative to hydrogen-bonding interactions in neat water, preferentially binds to hydrophobic solutes thereby raising their solubility. We find that this process is driven by a reduced entropic expense of opening up molecular-sized cavities close to the acetone methyl moieties. Sodium chloride and dimethyl sulfoxide are strongly hydrated, causing entropy to oppose hydrophobic solute insertion even stronger than it does in neat water. In sodium chloride/water the solute is preferentially “wetted” causing it to be “salted-out”. Dimethyl sulfoxide methyl moieties bind to the hydrophobic solute. This process, occurring at the expense of entropy, is driven by a favorable solute-solvent energy and causes “salting-in” of the hydrophobic solute.},

The first one is a new method for the determination of the multicanonical weight factor. In this method, a short replica-exchange simulation is performed and the multicanonical weight factor is obtained by the multiple histogram reweighting techniques. The second one is a further extension of the first in which a replica-exchange multicanonical simulation is performed with a small number of replicas. These new algorithms are particularly useful for studying the protein folding problem. {(C)} 2000 Elsevier Science {B.V,} All rights reserved.},

	doi = {10.1021/ci049884m},
	abstract = {The correlations between Caco-2 permeability {(logPapp)} and molecular properties have been investigated. A training set of 77 structurally diverse organic molecules was used to construct significant {QSAR} models for Caco-2 cell permeation. Cellular permeation was found to depend primarily upon experimental distribution coefficient {(logD)} at {pH} = 7.4, high charged polar surface area {(HCPSA),} and radius of gyration (rgyr). Among these three descriptors, {logD} may have the largest impact on diffusion through Caco-2 cell because {logD} shows obvious linear correlation with {logPapp} (r=0.703) when {logD} is smaller than 2.0. High polar surface area will be unfavorable to achieve good Caco-2 permeability because higher polar surface area will introduce stronger H-bonding interactions between Caco-2 cells and drugs. The comparison among {HCPSA,} {PSA} (polar surface area), and {TPSA} (topological polar surface area) implies that high-charged atoms may be more important to the interactions between Caco-2 cell and drugs. Besides {logD} and {HCPSA,} rgyr is also closely connected with Caco-2 permeabilities. The molecules with larger rgyr are more difficult to cross Caco-2 monolayers than those with smaller rgyr. The descriptors included in the prediction models permit the interpretation in structural terms of the passive permeability process, evidencing the main role of lipholiphicity, H-bonding, and bulk properties. Besides these three molecular descriptors, the influence of other molecular descriptors was also investigated. From the calculated results, it can be found that introducing descriptors concerned with molecular flexibility can improve the linear correlation. The resulting model with four descriptors bears good statistical significance, n = 77, r = 0.82, q = 0.79, s = 0.45, F = 35.7. The actual predictive abilities of the {QSAR} model were validated through an external validation test set of 23 diverse compounds. The predictions for the tested compounds are as the same accuracy as the compounds of the training set and significantly better than those predicted by using the model reported. The good predictive ability suggests that the proposed model may be a good tool for fast screening of {logPapp} for compound libraries or large sets of new chemical entities via combinatorial chemistry synthesis.},

For a diatomic with point charges (dipole moment=2.4 D) in a box of water, the free energy corresponding to charge rearrangements of the order of +/-0.25e could be predicted accurately after 750 ps of simulation and inclusion of the third derivative. Predictions were best for small perturbations. After 1000 ps of simulation, the first, second, third, and probably the fourth derivatives had converged, while the fifth was still oscillating.

Unfortunately, they tend to aggregate when stored under the concentrated conditions required in their usage. Aggregation leads to a decrease in antibody activity and could elicit an immunological response. Using full antibody atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we identify the antibody regions prone to aggregation by using a technology that we developed called spatial aggregation propensity {(SAP).} {SAP} identifies the location and size of these aggregation prone regions, and allows us to perform target mutations of those regions to engineer antibodies for stability. We apply this method to therapeutic antibodies and demonstrate the significantly enhanced stability of our mutants compared with the wild type. The technology described here could be used to incorporate developability in a rational way during the screening of antibodies in the discovery phase for several diseases.},

of hydrogen from one atom to another. The different tautomers of a molecule usually have different molecular fingerprints,
hydrophobicities and {pKa’s} as well as different {3D} shape and electrostatic properties; additionally, proteins frequently preferentially bind a tautomer
that is present in low abundance in water. As a result, the proper treatment of molecules that can tautomerize, {\textasciitilde}25\% of a
database, is a challenge for every aspect of computer-aided molecular design. Library design that focuses on molecular similarity
or diversity might inadvertently include similar molecules that happen to be encoded as different tautomers. Physical property
measurements might not establish the properties of individual tautomers with the result that algorithms based on these measurements
may be less accurate for molecules that can tautomerize—this problem influences the accuracy of filtering for library design
and also traditional {QSAR.} Any {2D} or {3D} {QSAR} analysis must involve the decision of if or how to adjust the observed K
i or {IC50} for the tautomerization equilibria. {QSARs} and recursive partitioning methods also involve the decision as to which tautomer(s)
to use to calculate the molecular descriptors. Docking virtual screening must involve the decision as to which tautomers to
include in the docking and how to account for tautomerization in the scoring. All of these decisions are more difficult because
there is no extensive database of measured tautomeric ratios in both water and non-aqueous solvents and there is no consensus
as to the best computational method to calculate tautomeric ratios in different environments.},

The present form is more appropriate for computer application of Jarzynski's relation where the dissipative work is frequently much greater than ksub {BT.} Monte Carlo sampling of very short nonequilibrium trajectories yields good estimates of the equilibrium free energy change. The procedure can be thought of as a generalization of thermodynamic integration in ordinary free energy calculations. Very short trajectories can be used to compute the free energy difference. In the infinitely short trajectory limit, we recover the thermodynamic integration scheme. We also show that free energy estimate can be obtained from moments of the work distribution. The last result is most useful for experimental measurements of the free energy. (16 refs.)},

	abstract = {Along with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors {(NRTIs)} and protease inhibitors {(PIs),} nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors {(NNRTIs)} have gained a definitive and important place in the treatment of {HIV-1} infections, and are in rapid development. These compounds can be grouped into two classes: the first generation {NNRTIs,} mainly discovered by random screening, and the second generation {NNRTIs,} developed as a result of comprehensive strategies involving molecular modelling, rationale-based drug synthesis, biological and pharmacokinetic evaluations. The recent boom of {NNRTIs} is mainly due to their antiviral potency, high specificity and low toxicity. The rapid emergence of drug-resistant {HIV-1} strains induced by the first generation drugs is a disadvantage bypassed, in part, by the broad spectrum second generation {NNRTIs.} Starting from the first generation, this review will focus on the second generation {NNRTIs} dealing with the recent and most interesting published results, highlighting the guidelines for the development of a third generation of {NNRTIs.} {[ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR]}},

	abstract = {Our understanding of the principles underlying the protein-folding problem can be tested by developing and characterizing simple models that make predictions which can be compared to experimental data. Here we extend our earlier model of folding free energy landscapes, in which each residue is considered to be either folded as in the native state or completely disordered, by investigating the role of additional factors representing hydrogen bonding and backbone torsion strain, and by using a hybrid between the master equation approach and the simple transition state theory to evaluate kinelics near the free energy barrier in greater detail. Model calculations of folding phi-values are compared to experimental data for 19 proteins, and for more than half of these, experimental data are reproduced with correlation coefficients between r = 0.41 and 0.88; calculations of transition state free energy barriers correlate with rates measured for 37 single domain proteins (r = 0.69). The model provides insight into the contribution of alternative-folding pathways, the validity of quasi-equilibrium treatments of the folding landscape, and the magnitude of the Arrhenius prefactor for protein folding. Finally, we discuss the limitations of simple native-state-based models, and as a more general test of such models, provide predictions of folding rates and mechanisms for a comprehensive set of over 400 small protein domains of known structure.},

It controls the pharmacokinetic behavior of drugs and is, in many cases, a prerequisite for intracellular targeting. Permeation of in vivo barriers is in general predicted from lipophilicity and related parameters. This article goes beyond the empirical correlations, and elucidates the processes and their interplay determining bilayer permeation. A flip-flop model for bilayer permeation, which considers the partitioning rate constants beside the translocation rate constants, is compared with the diffusion model based on Fick's first law. According to the flip-flop model, the ratios of aqueous volumes to barrier area can determine whether partitioning or translocation is rate-limiting. The flip-flop model allows permeation of anions and cations, and expands our understanding of {pH-dependent} permeation kinetics. Some experimental evidences for ion-controlled permeation at {pH} 7 are also included in this work.},

Our goal is to develop a job release schedule that not only minimizes tardiness but also maximizes flexibility. The philosophy can be characterized as one that seeks to "release as late as possible, but no later!" Our methodology is based on Monte Carlo simulation and consequent optimization by a method that became known as "stochastic counterpart" or "sample path" simulation-based optimization techniques. We use this method to minimize an expected value objective function that contains terms for tardiness and flow time "costs." We include a discussion of how the cost parameters of this objective function can be obtained by considering a "characteristic curve" for the system. We also discuss means for obtaining sensitivity analysis with respect to due dates and service times distributions parameters. We conclude with a numerical example.},

	abstract = {An increasing number of studies have reported computations of the standard (absolute) binding free energy of small ligands to proteins using molecular dynamics {(MD)} simulations and explicit solvent molecules that are in good agreement with experiments. This encouraging progress suggests that physics-based approaches hold the promise of making important contributions to the process of drug discovery and optimization in the near future. Two types of approaches are principally used to compute binding free energies with {MD} simulations. The most widely known is the alchemical double decoupling method, in which the interaction of the ligand with its surroundings are progressively switched off. It is also possible to use a potential of mean force {(PMF)} method, in which the ligand is physically separated from the protein receptor. For both of these computational approaches, restraining potentials may be activated and released during the simulation for sampling efficiently the changes in translational, rotational, and conformational freedom of the ligand and protein upon binding. Because such restraining potentials add bias to the simulations, it is important that their effects be rigorously removed to yield a binding free energy that is properly unbiased with respect to the standard state. A review of recent results is presented, and differences in computational methods are discussed. Examples of computations with T4-lysozyme mutants, {FKBP12,} {SH2} domain, and cytochrome P450 are discussed and compared. Remaining difficulties and challenges are highlighted.},

Here, we study the conformational changes associated with the opening and closing of the channel pore. Based on recent crystal structures of two prokaryotic members of the family in open and closed states, respectively, mixed elastic network models are constructed for the transmembrane domain. To explore the conformational changes in the gating transition, a coarse-grained transition path is computed that smoothly connects the closed and open conformations of the channel. We find that the conformational transition involves no major rotations of the transmembrane helices, and is instead characterized by a concerted tilting of helices M2 and M3. In addition, helix M2 changes its bending state, which results in an early closure of the pore during the open-to-closed transition.},

vacuum-water transfer free energies {(Task} 1) and tautomeric ratios in aqueous solution {(Task} 2) for the {SAMPL2} test set. The
bulk-electrostatic contribution to the free energy of solvation is treated as follows: {SM8} employs the generalized Born model
with the Coulomb field approximation, {SM8AD} employs the generalized Born approximation with asymmetric descreening, and {SMD}
solves the nonhomogeneous Poisson equation. The non-bulk-electrostatic contribution arising from short-range interactions
between the solute and solvent molecules in the first solvation shell is treated as a sum of terms that are products of geometry-dependent
atomic surface tensions and solvent-accessible surface areas of the individual atoms of the solute. On average, three models
tested in the present work perform similarly. In particular, we achieved mean unsigned errors of 1.3 {(SM8),} 2.0 {(SM8AD),} and
2.6 kcal/mol {(SMD)} for the aqueous free energies of 30 out of 31 compounds with known reference data involved in Task 1 and

The mean force and the mean covariance of the force with the energy in solution are calculated from molecular dynamics simulation followed by integration of these quantities with respect to the reaction coordinate R. The alternative approach examined (solvation pathway) would first remove the solutes from the solution using thermodynamic integration as function of a solvation coupling parameter [lambda], change the solute-solute distance in vacuo and then solvate back the solute pair at the new separation distance. The system studied was a pair of {CH4} molecules in water. We investigate the influence of the {CH4-water} interaction strength on the obtained {[Delta]Fassoc} and {[Delta]Sassoc} values by changing van der Waals and Coulomb interaction and evaluated the accuracy and efficiency for the two pathways. We find that the direct route seems more suitable for the calculation of free energies of hydrophobic solutes while the solvation pathway performs better when calculating entropy changes for solutes that have a stronger interaction with the solvent.},

	abstract = {The evaluation of performance of a design for complex discrete event systems through simulation is usually very time consuming. Optimizing the system performance becomes even more computationally infeasible. Ordinal optimization {(OO)} is a technique introduced to attack this difficulty in system design by looking at "order" in performances among designs instead of "value" and providing a probability guarantee for a good enough solution instead of the best for sure. The selection rule, known as the rule to decide which subset of designs to select as the {OO} solution, is a key step in applying the {OO} method. Pairwise elimination and round robin comparison are two selection rule examples. Many other selection rules are also frequently used in the ordinal optimization literature. To compare selection rules, we first identify some general facts about selection rules. Then we use regression functions to quantify the efficiency of a group of selection rules, including some frequently used rules. A procedure to predict good selection rules is proposed and verified by simulation and by examples. Selection rules that work well most of the time are recommended.},

@article{Burger2013,
abstract = {Due to the computational cost involved, when developing a force field for new compounds, one often avoids fitting van der Waals (vdW) terms, instead relying on a general force field based on the atom type. Here, we provide a novel approach to efficiently optimize vdW terms, based on both ab initio dimer energies and condensed phase properties. The approach avoids the computational challenges of searching the parameter space by using an extrapolation method to obtain a reliable difference quotient for the parameter derivatives based on the central difference. The derivatives are then used in an active-space optimization method which convergences quadratically. This method is applicable to polarizable and nonpolarizable force fields, although we focus on the parameterization of the AMBER force field. The scaling of the electrostatic potential (ESP) of the compounds is also studied. The algorithm is tested on 12 compounds, reducing the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the density from 0.061 g/cm(3) with GAFF parameters to 0.004 g/cm(3) , and the heat of vaporization from 1.13 to 0.05 kcal/mol. This is done with only four iterations of molecular dynamic runs. Using the optimized vdW parameters, the RMSE of the self-diffusion (Dself ) was reduced from 1.22 × 10(-9) to 0.78 × 10(-9) m(2) s(-1) and the RMSE of the hydration free energies ($\Delta$Gsolv ) was reduced from 0.30 to 0.26 kcal/mol. Scaling the ESP to improve dimer energies resulted in the Dself RMSE improving to 0.77× 10(-9) m(2) s(-1) , but the $\Delta$Gsolv worsened to 0.33 kcal/mol. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Interest in studying amines and fluorine-substituted compounds has risen from their intrinsic physicochemical properties and their prevalence in biological and pharmaceutical compounds. In the present study, a previously developed approach which optimizes Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters via the use of rare gas atoms combined with the reproduction of experimental condensed phase properties was extended to polar–neutral compounds. Compounds studied included four amines (ammonia, methylamine, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine) and three fluoroethanes (1-fluoroethane, 1,1-difluoroethane, and 1,1,1-trifluoroethane). The resulting force field yielded heats of vaporization and molecular volumes in excellent agreement with the experiment, with average differences less than 1%. The current amine CHARMM parameters successfully reproduced experimental aqueous solvation data where methylamine is more hydrophilic than ammonia, with hydrophobicity increasing with additional methylation on the nitrogen. For both the amines and fluoroethanes the parabolic relationship of the extent of methylation or fluorination, respectively, to the heats of vaporization were reproduced by the new parameters. The present results are also discussed with respect to the impact of parameterization approach to molecular details obtained from computer simulations and to the unique biological properties of fluorine in pharmaceutical compounds. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The program was developed to facilitate the fitting of molecular potential energy surfaces (PES) to spectroscopic and scattering data, but is also applicable to a variety of other optimization problems. A range of different algorithms adapted to highly nonlinear least-squares problems may be selected. The interactive nature of the code permits rapid and flexible control over the progress of the fit. I-NoLLS is written in a modular way that allows the easy incorporation of new modules for calculating observable quantities from model parameters. The structure of the program allows straightforward parallelisation of the time-consuming property calculations. In pilot applications, I-NoLLS has been interfaced with programs for calculating bound states of Van der Waals complexes, cross sections for molecular scattering processes, and second virial coefficients of gas mixtures. Parallelisation of the property calculations has been achieved using \{PVM\} running on a cluster of workstations.}
