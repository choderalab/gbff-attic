Acc. 2003, 109, 140]. Here, we use the framework provided by {REPDSTR} to combine a staged free energy perturbation protocol with replica-exchange molecular dynamics {(FEP/REMD).} The structure of {REPDSTR,} which allows multiple parallel input/output {(I/O),} facilitates the treatment of replica-exchange to couple the N window simulations corresponding to different values of the thermodynamic coupling parameters. As a result, each of the N synchronous window simulations benefit from the sampling carried out by the N-1 others. As illustrative examples of the {FEP/REMD} strategy, calculations of the absolute hydration and binding free energy of small molecules were performed using the biomolecular simulation program {CHARMM} adapted for the {IBM} Blue {Gene/P} platform. The computations show that a {FEP/REMD} strategy significantly improves the sampling and accelerates the convergence of absolute free energy computations.},

	abstract = {Perturbation theory has been applied to calculate the relative free energies of hydration of methanol and ethane in dilute solution. It is demonstrated that only two or three Monte Carlo simulations using double-wide sampling are necessary to obtain results with high precision. The small statistical uncertainty in the computed change in free energy of hydration and the good accord with experimental thermodynamic data are most encouraging for application of the procedure to a wide range of problems. Structural effects accompanying the mutation of methanol to ethane in water are also discussed, hydrogen bonding to the solute is essentially eliminated by only a 25\% reduction in the atomic charges of methanol.

The test case that has been examined is liquid hexane. {OPLS} potential functions have been used with sampling of external motions and internal angle bending and torsions. The {BOSS} 3.6 and {AMBER} 4.0 programs were used to perform the internal-coordinate Monte Carlo and Cartesian molecular dynamics simulations, respectively, for samples of 267 molecules in the {NPT} ensemble at 25 degrees C and 1 atm with periodic boundary conditions. The initial configurations of the system were equilibrated with the-hexane molecules in the all trans configuration. The major findings are (1) the Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics results for thermodynamic properties and conformer populations are in accord, (2) the conformer populations reach equilibrium in ca. 10(7) Monte Carlo configurations or 100 ps of molecular dynamics, and (3) the molecular dynamics calculations require 1.6-3.8 times more computer time to achieve the same level of convergence as the Monte Carlo simulations. The viability of internal-coordinate Monte Carlo methodology contrasts with earlier notions on the inefficiency of Cartesian Monte Carlo methods. Monte Carlo sampling in related contexts such as for side-chain torsional motion in proteins appears promising.},

To evaluate accuracy, key comparisons with available experimental thermodynamic and structural data including heats of vaporization, molecular volumes, fluctuational properties, and radial distribution functions for the liquids as well as free energies of hydration were made and found to be in reasonable accord. Revisitation of the united-atom model showed that the all-atom force field performs with overall superiority (e.g., average deviations from experimentally measured free energies of hydration were reduced from 0.36 to 0.13 kcal/mol).

The average energy {RMS} deviation from the {LMP2/cc-pVTZ(-f)//HF/6-31G**} data is reduced by ca. 40\% from 0.81 to 0.47 kcal/mol as a result of the fitting for the electrostatically uncharged dipeptides, Transferability of the parameters is demonstrated by using the same alanine dipeptide-fitted backbone torsional parameters for all of the other dipeptides (with the appropriate side-chain refitting) and the alanine tetrapeptide. Parameters of nonbonded interactions have also been refitted for the sulfur-containing dipeptides (cysteine and methionine), and the validity of the new Coulombic charges and the van der Waals sigma 's and epsilon 's is proved through reproducing gas-phase energies of complex formation heats of vaporization and densities of pure model liquids.

	volume = {41},
	abstract = {Monte Carlo {(MC)} simulations in combination with a linear response approach were used to estimate the free energies of binding for a series of 12 {TIBO} nonnucleoside inhibitors of {HIV-1} reverse transcriptase. Separate correlations were made for the R6 and S6 absolute conformations of the inhibitors, as well as for the analogous N6-monoprotonated species. Models based upon the neutral unbound inhibitors produced overall better fits to experimental values than did those using the protonated unbound inhibitors, with only slight differences between the neutral R6 and S6 cases. The best results were obtained with a three-parameter linear response equation containing van der Waals (alpha), electrostatic (beta), and solvent accessible surface area {(SASA,} gamma) terms. The averaged {(R6} and S6) rms error was approximately 0.88 kcal/mol for the observed range of 4.06 kcal/mol in inhibitor activities. The averaged values of alpha, beta, and gamma were -0.150, 0.114, and 0. 0286, respectively. Omission of the alpha term gave beta 0.152 and gamma 0.022 with a rms of 0.92. The unweighted van der Waals components were found to be highly attractive but failed to correlate well across the series of inhibitors. Contrastingly, while the electrostatic components are all repulsive, they show a direct correlation with inhibitor activity as measured by {DeltaGbinding.} The role of gamma is primarily to produce an overall negative binding energy, and it can effectively be replaced with a negative constant. During the {MC} simulations of the unbound solvated inhibitors, the R6 and S6 absolute conformations do not interconvert due to the formation of a favorable hydrogen bond to solvent. In the complex, however, interconversion of these conformations of the inhibitor is observed during the course of the simulations, a phenomenon which is apparently not observed in the crystalline state of the complex. Hydrogen bonding of the inhibitor to the backbone {NH} of K101 and the lack of such an interaction with the {C=O} of K101 or with solvent correlate with enhanced activity, as does the ability to assume a number of different orientations of the inhibitor dimethylallyl moiety with respect to residues Y181 and Y188 while retaining contact with W229. Overall, the use of a combination of {MC} simulation with a linear response method shows promise as a relatively rapid means of estimating inhibitor activities. This approach should be useful in the preliminary evaluation of potential modifications to known inhibitors to enhance activity.},

	abstract = {A computational model of the non-nucleoside inhibitor {8-Cl} {TIBO} complexed with {HIV-1} reverse transcriptase {(RT)} was constructed in order to determine the binding free energies. Using Monte Carlo simulations, both free energy perturbation and linear response calculations were carried out for the transformation of wild-type {RT} to two key mutants, {Y181C} and {L100I.} The newer linear response method estimates binding free energies based on changes in electrostatic and van der Waals energies and solvent-accessible surface areas. In addition, the change in stability of the protein between the folded and unfolded states was estimated for each of these mutations, which are known to emerge upon treatment with the inhibitor. Results from the calculations revealed that there is a large hydrophobic contribution to protein stability in the native, folded state. The calculated absolute free energies of binding from both the linear response, and also the more rigorous free energy perturbation method, gave excellent agreement with the experimental differences in activity. The success of the relatively rapid linear response method in predicting experimental activities holds promise for estimating the activity of the inhibitors not only against the wild-type {RT,} but also against key protein variants whose emergence undermines the efficacy of the drugs.},

	abstract = {The binding of ligands to protein receptors with high affinity and specificity is central to many cellular processes. The quest for the development of computational models capable of accurately evaluating binding affinity remains one of the main goals of modern computational biophysics. In this work, free energy perturbation/molecular dynamics simulations were used to evaluate absolute and relative binding affinity for three different antidepressants to a sodium-dependent membrane transporter, {LeuT,} a bacterial homologue of human serotonin and dopamine transporters. Dysfunction of these membrane transporters in mammals has been implicated in multiple diseases of the nervous system, including bipolar disorder and depression. Furthermore, these proteins are key targets for antidepressants including fluoxetine (aka Prozac) and tricyclic antidepressants known to block transport activity. In addition to being clinically relevant, this system, where multiple crystal structures are readily available, represents an ideal testing ground for methods used to study the molecular mechanisms of ligand binding to membrane proteins. We discuss possible pitfalls and different levels of approximation required to evaluate binding affinity, such as the dependence of the computed affinities on the strength of constraints and the sensitivity of the computed affinities to the particular partial charges derived from restrained electrostatic potential fitting of quantum mechanics electrostatic potential. Finally, we compare the effects of different constraint schemes on the absolute and relative binding affinities obtained from free energy simulations.},

It is also possible to use a potential of mean force (PMF) method, in which the ligand is physically separated from the protein receptor.

  abstract = {Applications of molecular simulations targeted at the estimation of free energies 
are reviewed, with a glimpse into their promising future. The methodological milestones 
paving the road of free energy calculations are summarized, in particular free energy perturbation and thermodynamic integration, in the framework of constrained or unconstrained molecular dynamics. The continuing difficulties encountered when attempting to obtain accurate estimates are discussed with an emphasis on the usefulness of large--scale numerical simulations in non--academic environments, like the world of the pharmaceutical industry. Applications of the free energy arsenal of methods is illustrated through a variety of biologically relevant problems, among which the prediction of protein--ligand binding constants, the determination of membrane--water partition coefficients of small, pharmacologically active compounds --- in connection with the blood--brain barrier, the folding of a short hydrophobic peptide, and the association of transmembrane alpha--helical domains, in line with the ``two--stage'' model of membrane protein folding. Current strategies for improving the reliability of 
free energy calculations, while making them somewhat more affordable, and, therefore, more compatible with the constraints of an industrial environment, are outlined.},

  abstract = {Hydration of protein cavities influences protein stability, dynamics, and function. Protein active sites usually contain water molecules that, upon ligand binding, are either displaced into bulk solvent or retained to mediate protein-ligand interactions. The contribution of water molecules to ligand binding must be accounted for to compute accurate values of binding affinities. This requires estimation of the extent of hydration of the binding site. However, it is often difficult to identify the water molecules involved in the binding process when ligands bind on the surface of a protein. Cytochrome P450cam is, therefore, an ideal model system because its substrate binds in a buried active site, displacing partially disordered solvent, and the protein is well characterized experimentally. We calculated the free energy differences for having five to eight water molecules in the active site cavity of the unliganded enzyme from molecular dynamics simulations by thermodynamic integration employing a three-stage perturbation scheme. The computed free energy differences between the hydration states are small (within 12 kJ mol-1) but distinct. Consistent with the crystallographic determination and studies employing hydrostatic pressure, we calculated that, although ten water molecules could in principle occupy the volume of the active site, occupation by five to six water molecules is thermodynamically most favorable.

  abstract = {A central challenge in structure-based ligand design is the accurate prediction of binding free energies. Here we apply alchemical free energy calculations in explicit solvent to predict ligand binding in a model cavity in T4 lysozyme. Even in this simple site, there are challenges. We made systematic improvements, beginning with single poses from docking, then including multiple poses, additional protein conformational changes, and using an improved charge model. Computed absolute binding free energies had an RMS error of 1.9 kcal/mol relative to previously determined. experimental values. In blind prospective tests, the methods correctly discriminated between several true ligands and decoys in a set of putative binders identified by docking. In these prospective tests, the RMS error in predicted binding free energies relative to those subsequently determined experimentally was only 0.6 kcal/mol. X-ray crystal structures of the new ligands bound in the cavity corresponded closely to predictions from the free energy calculations, but sometimes differed from those predicted by docking. Finally, we examined the impact of holding the protein rigid, as in docking, with a view to learning how approximations made in docking affect accuracy and how they may be improved.

abstract = {We review insights from computational studies of affinities of ligands binding to proteins. The power of 
structural biology is in translating knowledge of protein structures into insights about their forces, binding, 
and mechanisms. However, the complementary power of computer modeling is in showing ``the rest of the 
story'' (i.e., how motions and ensembles and alternative conformers and the entropies and forces that 
cannot be seen in single molecular structures also contribute to binding affinities). Upon binding to a protein,

waters, ions, or cofactors can have unexpected involvement; and conformational or solvation entropies

	volume = {47},
	abstract = {Abstract: A virtual screening protocol has been applied to seek non-nucleoside inhibitors of {HIV-1} reverse transcriptase {(NNRTIs)} and its {K103N} mutant. First, a chemical similarity search on the Maybridge library was performed using known {NNRTIs} as reference structures. The top-ranked molecules obtained from this procedure plus 26 known {NNRTIs} were then docked into the binding sites of the wild-type reverse transcriptase {(HIV-RT)} and its {K103N} variant {(K103N-RT)} using Glide 3.5. The top-ranked 100 compounds from the docking for both proteins were post-scored with a procedure using molecular mechanics and continuum solvation {(MM-GB/SA).} The validity of the virtual screening protocol was supported by (i) testing of the {MM-GB/SA} procedure, (ii) agreement between predicted and crystallographic binding poses, (iii) recovery of known potent {NNRTIs} at the top of both rankings, and (iv) identification of top-scoring library compounds that are close in structure to recently reported {NNRTI} {HTS} hits. However, purchase and assaying of selected top-scoring compounds from the library failed to yield active {anti-HIV} agents. Nevertheless, the highest-ranked database compound, S10087, was pursued as containing a potentially viable core. Subsequent synthesis and assaying of S10087 analogues proposed by further computational analysis yielded {anti-HIV} agents with {EC50} values as low as 310 {nM.} Thus, with the aid of computational tools, it was possible to evolve a false positive into a true active.},

These were converted to absolute quantities through perturbations to reference molecules for which absolute free energies of hydration had been obtained previously in {TIP4P} water. The average errors in the computed absolute free energies of hydration are 1.1 kcal/mol for the {6-31G*} {EPS} charges and 4.0 kcal/mol for the Mulliken charges. For the {EPS} charges, the largest individual errors are under 2 kcal/mol except for acetamide, in which case the error is 3.7 kcal/mol.

	volume = {105},
	abstract = {The transferable potentials for phase equilibria-united atom {(TraPPE-UA)} force field for hydrocarbons is extended to primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols by introducing the following (pseudo-)atoms: common hydroxyl O and H for all alcohols, alpha {-CH3,} alpha {-CH2,} alpha {-CH,} and alpha {-C} for methanol, primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols, respectively. In the {TraPPE-UA} force field, the nonbonded interactions of these sites are governed by {Lennard-Jones} 12-6 potentials and Coulombic interactions of fixed partial charges. The values of these partial charges were borrowed from the optimized potentials for liquid simulations-united atom {(OPLS-UA)} force field {[Jorgensen,} W. L. J. Phys. Chern. 1986, 90, 1276]. The {Lennard-Jones} well depth and size parameters for the new interaction sites were determined by fitting to the single-component vapor-liquid-phase equilibria of a few selected model compounds. Although the well-depth parameters for the alpha -carbons could be taken directly from the {TraPPE-UA} parameters for the corresponding pseudoatoms in alkanes, the size parameters required small adjustments to reflect the differences in {C-C} and {C-O} bond lengths and the reduced electron density for alpha -carbons. Coupled-decoupled configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in the Gibbs and grand-canonical ensembles were carried out to calculate the one-component vapor-liquid coexistence curves for methanol, ethanol, propan-1-ol, propan-2-ol, butan-2-ol, 2-methylpropan-2-ol, pentan-1-ol, pentane-1,5-diol, and octan-1-ol, and to determine the binary phase diagrams for the mixtures of n-hexane/methanol and n-hexane/ethanol. It was found that the phase equilibria of the pure alcohols are accurately described by the {TraPPE-UA} force field, with mean unsigned deviations of about 1\% from the experimental},

	volume = {122},
	abstract = {Monte Carlo {(MC)} statistical mechanics simulations have been carried out for more than 200 organic solutes, including 125 drugs and related heterocycles, in aqueous solution. The calculations were highly automated and used the {OPLS-AA} force field augmented with {CM1P} partial charges. Configurationally averaged results were obtained for a variety of physically significant quantities including the solute-water Coulomb and {Lennard-Jones} interaction energies, solvent-accessible surface area {(SASA),} and numbers of donor and acceptor hydrogen bonds. Correlations were then obtained between these descriptors and gas to liquid free energies of solvation in hexadecane, octanol, and water and octanol/water partition coefficients. Linear regressions with three or four descriptors yielded fits with correlation coefficients, r(2), of 0.9 in all cases. The regression equation for log P(octanol/water) only needs four descriptors to provide an rms error of 0.55 for 200 diverse compounds, which is competitive with the best fragment methods. For water, the expanded data set of 85 solutes and improved statistical analyses bring into question the significance of the {Lennard-Jones} and surface area terms that have been featured in prior linear-response treatments. The results are sensitive to the choice of partial charges for the solute atoms; poor representation of some functional groups can lead to the need for specific corrections in the regression equations. This is expected to also be true for force-field-based scoring functions for protein-ligand binding. In all cases, the present descriptors that emerge as most significant sensibly reveal the key physical factors that control solvation, especially solute size in organic solvents and electrostatic interactions in water. Furthermore, additional {MC} simulations for solutes in both water and ethanol clearly demonstrate that the key differential between water and alcohols is the greater hydrogren-bond-donating ability of water, which explains the significance of a solute's hydrogen-bond-accepting; ability for log P(octanol/water).},

Key aspects of the structure-activity data are addressed here through computational analysis of {FAAH} inhibition using Monte Carlo {(MC)} simulations in conjunction with free energy perturbation {(FEP)} calculations. The {MC/FEP} simulations demonstrate that incorporation of pyridine at the C5 position of the 2-keto-oxazole and 2-keto-1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives significantly enhances binding affinity by formation of a hydrogen-bonded array between the pyridyl nitrogen and Lys142 and Thr236. The results also attribute the activity boost upon substitution of oxazole by oxadiazole to reduced steric interactions in the active site and a lower torsional energy penalty upon binding.},

	abstract = {Free Energy Perturbation with Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics {(FEP/REMD)} offers a powerful strategy to improve the convergence of free energy computations. In particular, it has been shown previously that a {FEP/REMD} scheme allowing random moves within an extended replica ensemble of thermodynamic coupling parameters ???????? can improve the statistical convergence in calculations of absolute binding free energy of ligands to proteins {[J.} Chem. Theory Comput. 2009, 5, 2583]. In the present study, {FEP/REMD} is extended and combined with an accelerated {MD} simulations method based on Hamiltonian replica-exchange {MD} {(H-REMD)} to overcome the additional problems arising from the existence of kinetically trapped conformations within the protein receptor. In the combined strategy, each system with a given thermodynamic coupling factor ?? in the extended ensemble is further coupled with a set of replicas evolving on a biased energy surface with boosting potentials used to accelerate the interconversion among different rotameric states of the side chains in the neighborhood of the binding site. Exchanges are allowed to occur alternatively along the axes corresponding to the thermodynamic coupling parameter ?? and the boosting potential, in an extended dual array of coupled ??- and {H-REMD} simulations. The method is implemented on the basis of new extensions to the {REPDSTR} module of the biomolecular simulation program {CHARMM.} As an illustrative example, the absolute binding free energy of p-xylene to the nonpolar cavity of the {L99A} mutant of the T4 lysozyme was calculated. The tests demonstrate that the dual {??-REMD} and {H-REMD} simulation scheme greatly accelerates the configurational sampling of the rotameric states of the side chains around the binding pocket, thereby improving the convergence of the {FEP} computations.},

The continuing difficulties encountered when attempting to obtain accurate estimates are discussed with an emphasis on the usefulness of large--scale numerical simulations in non--academic environments, like the world of the pharmaceutical industry. Applications of the free energy arsenal of methods is illustrated through a variety of biologically relevant problems, among which the prediction of protein--ligand binding constants, the determination of membrane--water partition coefficients of small, pharmacologically active compounds --- in connection with the blood--brain barrier, the folding of a short hydrophobic peptide, and the association of transmembrane alpha--helical domains, in line with the ``two--stage'' model of membrane protein folding. Current strategies for improving the reliability of 
free energy calculations, while making them somewhat more affordable, and, therefore, more compatible with the constraints of an industrial environment, are outlined.},

  abstract = {Hydration of protein cavities influences protein stability, dynamics, and function. Protein active sites usually contain water molecules that, upon ligand binding, are either displaced into bulk solvent or retained to mediate protein-ligand interactions. The contribution of water molecules to ligand binding must be accounted for to compute accurate values of binding affinities. This requires estimation of the extent of hydration of the binding site. However, it is often difficult to identify the water molecules involved in the binding process when ligands bind on the surface of a protein. Cytochrome P450cam is, therefore, an ideal model system because its substrate binds in a buried active site, displacing partially disordered solvent, and the protein is well characterized experimentally. We calculated the free energy differences for having five to eight water molecules in the active site cavity of the unliganded enzyme from molecular dynamics simulations by thermodynamic integration employing a three-stage perturbation scheme. The computed free energy differences between the hydration states are small (within 12 kJ mol-1) but distinct. Consistent with the crystallographic determination and studies employing hydrostatic pressure, we calculated that, although ten water molecules could in principle occupy the volume of the active site, occupation by five to six water molecules is thermodynamically most favorable.

  abstract = {Free energy calculations are increasingly being used to estimate absolute and relative binding free energies of ligands to proteins. However, computed free energies often appear to depend on the initial protein conformation, indicating incomplete sampling. This is especially true when proteins can change conformation on ligand binding, as free energies associated with these conformational changes are either ignored or assumed to be included by virtue of the sampling performed in the calculation. Here, we show that, in a model protein system (a designed binding site in T4 lysozyme), conformational changes can make a difference of several kcal/mol in computed binding free energies and that they are neglected in computed binding free energies if the system remains kinetically trapped in a particular metastable state on simulation timescales. We introduce a general "confine-and-release" framework for free energy calculations that accounts for these free energies of conformational change. We illustrate its use in this model system by demonstrating that an umbrella sampling protocol can obtain converged binding free energies that are independent of the starting protein structure and include these conformational change free energies.},

abstract = {Using molecular dynamics free energy simulations with TIP3P explicit solvent, we compute the hydration free energies of 504 neutral small organic molecules and compare them to experiments. We find, first, good general agreement between the simulations and the experiments, with an rms error of 1.24 kcal/mol over the whole set (i.e., about 2 kT) and a correlation coefficient of 0.89. Second, we use an automated procedure to identify systematic errors for some classes of compounds and suggest some improvements to the force field. We find that alkyne hydration free energies are particularly poorly predicted due to problems with a Lennard-Jones well depth and find that an alternate choice for this well depth largely rectifies the situation. Third, we study the nonpolar component of hydration free energies???that is, the part that is not due to electrostatics. While we find that repulsive and attractive components of the nonpolar part both scale roughly with surface area (or volume) of the solute, the total nonpo...},

It uses a simple functional form and a limited number of atom types, but incorporates both empirical and heuristic models to estimate force constants and partial atomic charges. The performance of {GAFF} in test cases is encouraging. In test I, 74 crystallographic structures were compared to {GAFF} minimized structures, with a root-mean-square displacement of 0.26 {AA,} which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force field (0.25 {AA)} and better than those of {MMFF} 94 and {CHARMm} (0.47 and 0.44 {AA,} respectively). In test {II,} gas phase minimizations were performed on 22 nucleic acid base pairs, and the minimized structures and intermolecular energies were compared to {MP2/6-31G*} results. The {RMS} of displacements and relative energies were 0.25 {AA} and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. These data are comparable to results from {Parm99/RESP} (0.16 {AA} and 1.18 kcal/mol, respectively), which were parameterized to these base pairs. Test {III} looked at the relative energies of 71 conformational pairs that were used in development of the Parm99 force field. The {RMS} error in relative energies (compared to experiment) is about 0.5 kcal/mol. {GAFF} can be applied to wide range of molecules in an automatic fashion, making it suitable for rational drug design and database searching.

	abstract = {The ff94 force field that is commonly associated with the Amber simulation package is one of the most widely used parameter sets for biomolecular simulation. After a decade of extensive use and testing, limitations in this force field, such as over-stabilization of alpha-helices, were reported by us and other researchers. This led to a number of attempts to improve these parameters, resulting in a variety of {"Amber"} force fields and significant difficulty in determining which should be used for a particular application. We show that several of these continue to suffer from inadequate balance between different secondary structure elements. In addition, the approach used in most of these studies neglected to account for the existence in Amber of two sets of backbone phi/psi dihedral terms. This led to parameter sets that provide unreasonable conformational preferences for glycine. We report here an effort to improve the phi/psi dihedral terms in the ff99 energy function. Dihedral term parameters are based on fitting the energies of multiple conformations of glycine and alanine tetrapeptides from high level ab initio quantum mechanical calculations. The new parameters for backbone dihedrals replace those in the existing ff99 force field. This parameter set, which we denote {ff99SB,} achieves a better balance of secondary structure elements as judged by improved distribution of backbone dihedrals for glycine and alanine with respect to {PDB} survey data. It also accomplishes improved agreement with published experimental data for conformational preferences of short alanine peptides and better accord with experimental {NMR} relaxation data of test protein systems.},

In the present paper, we show that these schemes represent special cases of a more general class of methods, and introduce several new algorithms in this class that offer practical advantages over all previously described methods for a wide range of problem parameters. We also show that several of these algorithms approach an approximate lower bound on inter-processor data transfer.},

	title = {{1-Octanol/Water} Partition Coefficients of {n-Alkanes} from Molecular Simulations of Absolute Solvation Free Energies},
	volume = {5},
	abstract = {The 1-octanol/water partition coefficient is an important thermodynamic variable usually employed to understand and quantify the partitioning of solutes between aqueous and organic phases. It finds widespread use in many empirical correlations to evaluate the environmental fate of pollutants as well as in the design of pharmaceuticals. The experimental evaluation of 1-octanol/water partition coefficients is an expensive and time-consuming procedure, and thus, theoretical estimation methods are needed, particularly when a physical sample of the solute may not yet be available, such as in pharmaceutical screening. {1-Octanol/water} partition coefficients can be obtained from Gibbs free energies of solvation of the solute in both the aqueous and the octanol phases. The accurate evaluation of free energy differences remains today a challenging problem in computational chemistry. In order to study the absolute solvation Gibbs free energies in 1-octanol, a solvent that can mimic many properties of important biological systems, free energy calculations for n-alkanes in the range {C1?C8} were performed using molecular simulation techniques, following the thermodynamic integration approach. In the first part of this paper, we test different force fields by evaluating their performance in reproducing pure 1-octanol properties. It is concluded that all-atom force fields can provide good accuracy but at the cost of a higher computational time compared to that of the united-atom force fields. Recent versions of united-atom force fields, such as Gromos and {TraPPE,} provide satisfactory results and are, thus, useful alternatives to the more expensive all-atom models. In the second part of the paper, the Gibbs free energy of solvation in 1-octanol is calculated for several n-alkanes using three force fields to describe the solutes, namely Gromos, {TraPPE,} and {OPLS-AA.} Generally, the results obtained are in excellent agreement with the available experimental data and are of similar accuracy to commonly used {QSPR} models. Moreover, we have estimated the Gibbs free energy of hydration for the different compounds with the three force fields, reaching average deviations from experimental data of less than 0.2 kcal/mol for the case of the Gromos force field. Finally, we systematically compare different strategies to obtain the 1-octanol/water partition coefficient from the simulations. It is shown that a fully predictive method combining the Gromos force field in the aqueous phase and the {OPLS-AA/TraPPE} force field for the organic phase can give excellent predictions for n-alkanes up to C8 with an absolute average deviation of 0.1 log P units to the experimental data.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics {(MD)} free energy perturbation {(FEP)} simulations were carried out in order to obtain insights into the structures and dynamics of a series of small organic solutes in water and water-saturated 1-octanol. Relative free energies of solvation were computed for each solute in both solvents, and these results were used to estimate the relative octanol/water partition coefficients (log P-ow). The relative octanol/ water partition coefficients were in good agreement with experimental log P-ow values (average unsigned error = 0.74 log units), if one omits the acetamide-acetone simulation which proved problematic. Partition coefficients were also calculated using the newly developed {GB/SA} octanol continuum solvation model in order to compare the {MD-FEP} and continuum model results. Interestingly, the computationally much more efficient {GB/SA} calculations proved to be more accurate (average unsigned error in log P-ow = 0.50 log units) than {FEP} for this set of 12 solutes.},
