	doi = {10.1021/jp0667442},
	abstract = {In molecular simulations with fixed-charge force fields, the choice of partial atomic charges influences numerous computed physical properties, including binding free energies. Many molecular mechanics force fields specify how nonbonded parameters should be determined, but various choices are often available for how these charges are to be determined for arbitrary small molecules. Here, we compute hydration free energies for a set of 44 small, neutral molecules in two different explicit water models {(TIP3P} and {TIP4P-Ew)} to examine the influence of charge model on agreement with experiment. Using the {AMBER} {GAFF} force field for nonbonded parameters, we test several different methods for obtaining partial atomic charges, including two fast methods exploiting semiempirical quantum calculations and methods deriving charges from the electrostatic potentials computed with several different levels of ab initio quantum calculations with and without a continuum reaction field treatment of solvent. We find that the best charge sets give a root-mean-square error from experiment of roughly 1 kcal/mol. Surprisingly, agreement with experimental hydration free energies does not increase substantially with increasing level of quantum theory, even when the quantum calculations are performed with a reaction field treatment to better model the aqueous phase. We also find that the semiempirical {AM1-BCC} method for computing charges works almost as well as any of the more computationally expensive ab initio methods and that the root-mean-square error reported here is similar to that for implicit solvent models reported in the literature. Further, we find that the discrepancy with experimental hydration free energies grows substantially with the polarity of the compound, as does its variation across theory levels.},

Configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in the Gibbs ensemble were carried out to calculate the vapor-liquid phase equilibria for methane, ethane, n-butane, n-pentane, and n-octane. The Williams, {OPLS-AA,} and {MMFF94} force fields were selected as representative all-atom models for this study because they were fitted using three different strategies {(Williams,} crystal structures and heats of sublimation; {OPLS-AA,} liquid densities and heats of vaporization; {MMFF94,} rare gas pair potentials and quantum mechanics) and employ potentials with the different functional forms to describe nonbonded van der Waals interactions {(Williams,} Buckingham exp-r(-6) {OPLS-AA,} {Lennard-Jones} 12-6; {MMFF94,} buffered 14-7). It is shown that seemingly small differences in the potential functions can account for very large changes in the fluid-phase behavior. The Williams and {OPLS-AA} force fields yield liquid densities, boiling temperatures, and critical points that are in acceptable, albeit not in quantitative agreement with experiments, whereas the fluid-phase behavior of the {MMFF94} model shows very large deviations.},

The program takes an initial set of compounds and iteratively builds new compounds based on the fitness scores of the previous set of compounds. We describe the particulars of the {ADAPT} algorithm and its application to three well-studied target systems.

The effective mesh size of this {DN} hydrogel is smaller than that of the {SN} hydrogels with the same water content and the same molecular weight between the cross-linking points {(Mc).} Applying uniaxial extensions, we obtained the stress−strain curves for the hydrogels. This shows that the {DN} hydrogel has a sudden increase of stress above ∼100\% strain, much higher than the sum of the stresses of the two {SN} hydrogels at the same strain. This arises because {PEO} has a smaller Mc value than {PAA,} so that the {PEO} in the {DN} reaches fully stretched out at 100\% strain that corresponds to 260\% strain in the {PEO} {SN} (beyond this point, the bond stretching and the angle bending increase dramatically). We also calculated the diffusion coefficients of solutes such as d-glucose and ascorbic acid in the hydrogels, where we find that the diffusion coefficients of those solutes in the {DN} hydrogel are 60\% of that in the {PEO} {SN} and 40\% of that in the {PAA} {SN} due to its smaller effective mesh size.},

	volume = {25},
	abstract = {A challenge in free energy calculation for complex molecular systems by computer simulation is to obtain a reliable estimate within feasible computational time. In this study, we suggest an answer to this challenge by exploring a simple method, overlap sampling {(OS),} for producing reliable free-energy results in an efficient way. The formalism of the {OS} method is based on ensuring sampling of important overlapping phase space during perturbation calculations. This technique samples both forward and reverse free energy perturbation {(FEP)} to improve the free-energy calculation. It considers the asymmetry of the {FEP} calculation and features an ability to optimize both the precision and the accuracy of the measurement without affecting the simulation process itself. The {OS} method is tested at two optimization levels: no optimization (simple {OS),} and full optimization (equivalent to Bennett's method), and compared to conventional {FEP} techniques, including the widely used direct {FEP} averaging method, on three alchemical mutation systems: (a) an anion transformation in water solution, (b) mutation between methanol and ethane, and (c) alchemical change of an adenosine molecule. It is consistently shown that the reliability of free-energy estimates can be greatly improved using the {OS} techniques at both optimization levels, while the performance of Bennett's method is particularly striking. In addition, the efficiency of a calculation can be significantly improved because the method is able to (a) converge to the right answer quickly, and (b) work for large perturbations. The basic two-stage {OS} method can be extended to admit additional stages, if needed. We suggest that the {OS} method can be used as a general perturbation technique for computing free energy differences in molecular simulations.},

It is shown that the method can be corrected either by including the missing terms or by changing to a more convenient coordinate system that does not require use of the rigid rotor approximation and hence is potentially more accurate.

	abstract = {Abstract: A new "super-extended cavity" tetraacetylcalix[4]pyrrole derivative was synthesized and characterized, and X-ray crystal structures of complexes bound to fluoride and acetonitrile were obtained. The binding behavior of this receptor was investigated by {NMR} titration, and the complex was found to exclusively bind fluoride ions in {DMSO-d6.} This unusual binding behavior was investigated by Monte Carlo free energy perturbation simulations and Poisson calculations, and the ion specificity was seen to result from the favorable electrostatic interactions that the fluoride gains by sitting lower in the phenolic cavity of the receptor. The effect of water present in the {DMSO} on the calculated free energies of binding was also investigated. Owing to the use of a saturated ion solution, the effect of contaminating water is small in this case; however, it has the potential to be very significant at lower ion concentrations. Finally, the adaptive umbrella {WHAM} protocol was investigated and optimized for use in binding free energy calculations, and its efficiency was compared to that of the free energy perturbation calculations; adaptive umbrella {WHAM} was found to be approximately two times more efficient. In addition, structural evidence demonstrates that the protocol explores a wider conformational range than free energy perturbation and should therefore be the method of choice. This paper represents the first complete application of this methodology to "alchemical" changes.},

Neither the detailed mechanism behind the powerful action of hypericin, arising as a result of light excitation, nor the intracellular localization and transportation is still fully understood. In the present work, molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to study the properties and the permeability of hypericin and modifications thereof, substituted with one or four bromine atoms, in a dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine lipid membrane. The molecules were found to accumulate in the most dense region of the lipids due to competing interactions with the hydrophobic lipid interior and the polar aqueous environment. This was confirmed by analyzing the radial distribution functions and by the density profiles of the system components. Calculated free energy profiles display large negative changes in free energy for the transport process of the molecules into the lipids, which also support this finding.

	abstract = {Recently published results determined from molecular dynamics {(MD)} modeling and simulation studies have shown that the spatial distribution of the density of immobilized charged ligands in ion-exchange porous adsorbent particles is most likely nonuniform and the adsorbent particles also exhibit local nonelectroneutrality. In this work, the functional forms of the nonuniform spatial distributions of the density of the immobilized ligands in four different porous adsorbent media that were determined by {MD} studies were employed in a macroscopic continuum model describing the transport and adsorption of a single protein in the porous particles of the four different adsorbent media. The results clearly show that inner radial humps in the concentration profiles of the adsorbed protein can occur when the spatial distribution of the density of the immobilized ligands in the porous adsorbent particles is nonuniform and also has local maxima or minima along the radial direction in the particle. The results also indicate that the rate at which the equilibrium condition is approached depends significantly on the functional form of the spatial distribution of the density of the immobilized ligands. When adsorption equilibrium has been reached, the concentration profile of the adsorbed protein exhibits the shape of the spatial distribution of the density of the immobilized ligands. The results suggest that the technique of confocal scanning laser microscopy could be used to measure the concentration profile of an adsorbed protein at equilibrium and this measurement could provide the spatial distribution of the density of the immobilized ligands, and such measurements could also be used for quality control of the adsorbent medium. The results in this work have also implications in the modeling, design, analysis, and quality control of systems involving biocatalysis. Furthermore, the results clearly indicate that it is very important to study the dynamic behavior of an adsorption system having a nonuniform spatial distribution in the density of the immobilized charged ligands and where (i) both monovalent and multivalent interactions between the single charged adsorbate and the immobilized charged ligands occur and (ii) the values of the {pH} and ionic strength are such that the electrophoretic effects are active.},

	abstract = {Chemistry Department, Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, Hauz Khas, New Delhi 11 00 16, India Smart polymeric materials respond with a considerable change in their properties to small changes in their environment. Environmental stimuli include temperature, {pH,} chemicals, and light. {“Smart”} stimuli-sensitive materials can be either synthetic or natural. This review discusses the application of smart materials as tools to solve biological problems such as bioseparation, drug delivery, biosensor design, tissue engineering, protein folding, and microfluidics. The goal for these endeavors is to mimic the “smartness” of biological systems and ultimately moderate complex systems such as immune responses at desired levels. The versatility and untapped potential of smart polymeric materials makes them one of the most exciting interfaces of chemistry and biology. Over the last decade, smart polymeric materials have been used in biochemical sciences in many ways. Since the term “smart polymeric materials” encompasses a wide spectrum of different compounds with unique potential for biological applications, and since interest in generating and manipulating these compounds is growing, we felt that it would be useful to assemble an overview of the field to aid in catalyzing cross-fertilization of ideas. The present review aims to bring together the exciting design of these materials and the ever-expanding range of their uses by focusing on hydrogels as a key example of this technology. Smart or stimuli-responsive polymers respond to small changes in their environment with dramatic changes in their physical properties {(Table} 1). Smart polymers are either reversibly soluble-insoluble {(SIS)} in aqueous media or crosslinked in the form of hydrogels. Specifically, hydrogels are networks of hydrophilic polymers that expand or swell by taking up “from 10\%–20\% up to thousands of times their dry weight in water” [1]. Physical hydrogels are held together with noncovalent forces, whereas chemical hydrogels are obtained by chemical crosslinking; both kinds of gels are structurally inhomogeneous. Physical hydrogels have hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains, whereas chemical hydrogels have “clusters” or regions of high crosslinking density (low swelling structure) present in an otherwise low crosslinking density (high swelling structure) polymeric network. During water uptake, hydration occurs first at hydrophilic moieties (“primary bound water”), then at hydrophobic sites (“secondary bound water”) and at spaces between the chains and pores (“free or bulk water”) [1]. {SIS} polymers can be synthetic {[poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)} and methylmethacrylates polymers] {(Figure} 1) or natural (alginate, chitosan, and κ-carrageenan [2 and 3]), or a combination of both [collagen-acrylate and poly(polyethylene glycol-co-peptides)] [1]. Both {SIS} polymers and hydrogels have been shown to respond to a variety of stimuli such as changes in {pH,} temperature, ionic strength, light, electricity, and magnetic field {(Table} 1) [4]. The swelling (uptake of additional water) and solubility responses for hydrogels and {SIS} polymers, respectively, have a common mechanism. Application of stimulus changes the nanostructure and increases or decreases the overall hydrophilicity. For example, a {pH-responsive} polymer (or hydrogel) could be subjected to ionization of a free carboxyl group (like in methacrylates), and a thermosensitive polymer, like {poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)} {[poly(NIPAAm)],} would deswell as the temperature is raised beyond lower critical solution temperature {(LCST).} The change in network volume (the smartness readout) arises because there is a balance of hydrophilic {(-CONH-)} and hydrophobic {[-CH(CH3)2-]} moieties, therefore, below {LCST;} the gel is swollen, hydrated, and hydrophilic. However, above {LCST} it is collapsed, dehydrated, and hydrophobic. The thermosensitive gel {poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)} {(NIPAAm)} is one of the most commonly studied smart systems, and various strategies for synthesizing the hydrogel and its derivatives have been described. Efforts have been directed toward altering the swelling/shrinking behavior and preparing copolymers that also respond to other stimuli. Critical insight into the deswelling mechanism was gained by the Hoffman group's seminal work on {PNIPAAm} [5]. Researchers showed that gel collapse at {LCST} {(38.5°C)} is entropy driven since bound water molecules are freed. Collapse is accompanied by “skin” formation around the trapped pockets of water; therefore, deswelling kinetics are biphasic with faster expulsion of water through weakly densified gel portions followed by slower release of water through the more densified collapsed gel layer on the surface. The comonomers (along with {NIPAAm)} which have been assessed are acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, 2-methyl-2-acrylamidopropane sulfonic acid, trimethyl-acrylamidopropyl ammonium 3-methyl-1-vinylimidazolium iodide, sodium acrylate, sodium methacrylate, and 1-(3-sulphopropyl)-2-vinyl-pyridinium betaine [6, 7 and 8]. The use of methacrylic acid, along with {NIPAAm,} not only changes {LCST} but also makes the hydrogels responsive to both temperature and {pH} [8]. Polymethacrylic acid chains do not expand readily before a critical charge density (due to ionized carboxyl groups) is reached. The copolymers of {NIPAAm} and methacrylic acid, in addition to hydrophobic and ionic binding, also involve hydrogen bonding between the amide and carboxyl groups of the two monomers [9]. Consequently, it was found that at any {pH} below {pKa} of the methacrylate moiety, the copolymers reached lower swelling ratios as compared to either of the homopolymers, since hydrogen bonding presumably acts as additional crosslinks that keep water out. Soluble copolymers of N-isopropylacrylamide and acrylic acid containing photodimerizable chromophores, like stilbene, styryl pyridinium, and acridizinium moieties, have been synthesized with a view to using light for inducing crosslinking [10]. Unfortunately, adequate reversibility of this photochemical switching could not be achieved in any of the cases. The most frequently used method of polymerizing {NIPAAm} with {N,N′-methylene} bisacrylamide as a crosslinker via free radical crosslinking polymerization is exothermic [11]. The usual polymerization temperatures are close to {LCST.} Thus, any local or overall temperature increase above {LCST} results in pockets of phase separation and formation of spatially inhomogeneous gels. Real-time temperature and photon transmission measurements showed that polymerization even below {LCST} produced inhomogeneous network, whereas at temperatures higher than {LCST,} the gel system “undergoes a phase transition via a spinodal decomposition process” [11]. Kim et al. [12] have grafted {PNIPAAm} onto the surface of {pH-responsive} alginate to obtain a macroporous hydrogel with faster swelling/deswelling rates. Much less work has been done with hydrogels, which respond to stimuli other than {pH,} temperature, and light. A hydrogel based upon ethylene-co-vinyl acetate, responsive to magnetic field, has been described [13]. Hydrogels based upon similar structures have also been described as responsive to ultrasonic radiation [13]. Of special interest are naturally occurring polysaccharides like chitosan, alginate, and κ-carrageenan that behave as reversibly soluble-insoluble polymers by responding to {pH,} Ca2+, and K+, respectively [2 and 3]. Recently, a polymer sensitive to {pH} and temperature has been prepared by genetic engineering [14]. These are block copolymers containing repeating sequences from silk {(GAGAGS)} and elastin {(GVGVP),} where, in some cases, valine has been replaced by glutamic acid. By varying the extent of this change, the sensitivity to {pH,} temperature, and ionic strength could be controlled fairly precisely. Recombinant methods have also been used to design multidomain assemblies in which leucine zipper domains flank a central flexible polyelectrolyte [15]. {pH/temperature} stimuli trigger sol-gel transition. Extrapolation of this to create a seamless conjugate with specific biological activity is an exciting possibility. The cost of the bioseparation step is a critical factor in determining the overall production cost of a protein. Use of smart polymers has led to some simple and economical strategies in bioseparation. In affinity precipitation, the smart macroaffinity ligand (soluble form) is mixed with the crude broth containing the target protein [2]. Usually, the smart macroaffinity ligand is prepared by chemical coupling of a suitable affinity ligand to a smart polymer. Occasionally, it is possible to exploit the inherent and fortuitous affinity of the polymer for the affinity capture of the desired protein. Applying specific stimuli for the smart polymer precipitates the complex of the macroaffinity ligand-target protein. The complex of the macroaffinity ligand-target protein is dissociated, and the smart macroaffinity ligand is usually recycled. The technique is scalable and does not require any costly equipment [2]. In many cases, selectivity of the affinity interactions ensures that the purity obtained is at least of the level of single band in {SDS-PAGE} [3, 4 and 16]. The use of aqueous two-phase systems (such as {PEG-dextran)} for protein separation has been around for a long time. It has been shown that smart macroaffinity ligand-target proteins can be recovered from the {PEG} phase, and the two phases can be reused. This approach was successfully demonstrated by the purification of microbial xylanases, pullulanases, wheat germ α-amylase, and sweet potato β-amylase [17 and 18]. Another attractive extension of this approach has been to separate animal cells by crafting the smart macroaffinity ligands by coupling an antibody (against a cell surface protein) to a smart polymer [19]. Macroaffinity ligand-facilitated three-phase partitioning {(MLFTPP)} converts three-phase partitioning {(TPP)} [4] into a more selective and predictable technique for bioseparation of proteins using smart affinity ligands [20, 21 and 22]. Techniques like affinity precipitation, aqueous two-phase partitioning, and {MLFTPP} remain underexploited by biochemists, as their description is limited to journals devoted to biochemical engineering/biotechnology. By now, these techniques show sufficient promise to be adopted and routinely used by biochemists and molecular biologists. Over the years, immobilized enzymes have emerged as the preferred forms in which enzymes are used for various applications. Use of smart polymers for immobilization of enzymes allows reuse of the biocatalyst after homogeneous catalysis [23]. The separation (and reuse) of the bioconjugate can be simply done by precipitation. Thus, the benefits of homogeneous catalysis can be combined with the convenience of recovery/reuse of heterogeneous catalysts. The advantage of homogeneous biocatalysis (by using a soluble form of the smart polymer-enzyme bioconjugate) may be illustrated by the example of {chitosan-α-L-rhamnopyranosidase} [24]. The immobilized enzyme retained the kinetic parameters {(Michaelis} constant, Km; and maximal velocity, Vmax) of the free enzyme. The biocatalyst was used successfully for increasing the aroma of a model wine solution [24]. In nonaqueous media, immobilization has been widely used for stabilization of the enzyme against inactivation due to the media [25]. A photoresponsive copolymer linked to subtilisin was successfully used for a transesterification reaction in toluene [26]. Unfortunately, the rate of transesterification was no better than enzyme powders, showing that the bioconjugation failed to stabilize the enzyme. Hydrogels have also been used for immobilizing enzymes. The pioneering work of Hoffman with β-galactosidase deserves special mention [27]. A more recent example is encapsulation of α-chymotrypsin in a photosensitive hydrogel [28]. When exposed to light of different wavelengths, the hydrogel changes its permeability to the amide substrate. This “on” and “off” cycle could be carried out repeatedly in a reversible fashion. Most extensive efforts in this area have been made for developing insulin release systems in response to high glucose levels [29]. In an early approach, entrapped insulin was released from copolymers of allylglucose crosslinked with Concanavalin A. In many later designs, glucose oxidase has been used to generate H+ (in response to the presence of glucose) and hence exploit {pH-sensitive} hydrogels. One common worry in all such cases is the slow response time. Thus, use of superporous hydrogels with fast swelling-deswelling kinetics ({\textless}1 min) is a step in the right direction [30]. The well-known interaction between boronic acid and sugars has been used to design glucose-responsive insulin-release systems [29]. To bring the {pH} of insulin release closer to the physiological conditions, it was necessary to coordinate the boron atom with an inbuilt amino group. It has also been possible to ensure that this system has a dosage capacity required for clinical use and is rechargeable once insulin is exhausted. Use of the presence of glucose to increase the {LCST} of the thermoresponsive hydrogels of acrylamidophenylboronic acid and {NIPAAm} has also been evaluated. This system did exhibit the useful characteristic of requiring a threshold glucose concentration to release insulin [29]. In a slightly different approach, {pH-sensitive} {poly(NIPAAm/MAA)} nanoparticles were embedded along with glucose oxidase and catalase in an ethylcellulose-based membrane [31]. The rate of insulin release was modulated by glucose concentration due to volume changes in the embedded nanoparticles. The response lag time was about 5–15 min as reduction of polymer dimension to nanometer led to faster response. Unfortunately, the permeability cycles (to test reusability) were not reproducible since the design did not “allow sufficient time for removing the diffusants from the membrane” [31]. Polyoxamer-407, a nontoxic copolymer consisting of polyethylene and polyoxypropylene, blocks changes reversibly from a low viscosity solution (at {4°C)} to a semisolid gel at body temperature [32]. In vivo results with intraperitonial administration of {melanotar-I} (an analog of {α-MSH)} along with polyoxamer showed that the polymer did prolong its half-life in plasma, presumably due to its slow release from the gel formed in the intraperitoneal cavity. A disadvantage of polyoxamers is that they are nonbiodegradable and are known to enhance plasma cholesterol and triacylglycerol after intraperitoneal injection in rats [33]. Jeong et al. [34] have described the synthesis of a thermoresponsive hydrogel consisting of blocks of poly(ethylene oxide) and {poly(L-lactic} acid). The polymer (at {45°C),} upon subcutaneous injection and subsequent rapid cooling to body temperature, undergoes a sol-gel transition. The entrapped drug was released at first by diffusion and then at a faster rate as degradation mechanisms started operating. Unlike {NIPAAm-based} polymers or polyoxamers, these nontoxic polymers are biodegradable and form biocompatible and pharmacologically inactive products. A {pH-responsive} hydrogel composed of polymethacrylic acid grafted with polyethylene glycol has been evaluated in vitro for calcitonin delivery [35]. This polypeptide is a therapeutic agent for bone diseases like Paget's disease, hypercalcemia, and osteoporesis. As the {pH} increased during the passage from the stomach to upper small intestine, the ionized pendant carboxyl groups caused electrostatic repulsion, the network swelled, and the hormone was released. The release behavior showed that movement of polymer chains was a key factor that controlled the solute transport. Qiu and Park [36] have also reviewed various hydrogels responsive to various stimuli. An example worth quoting from their review uses the concept of release of antibiotics at the site and time of infection. The antibiotic, Gentamycin, was attached to the polyvinyl alcohol backbone through peptide linkers. Infected wounds produced a higher concentration of thrombin which snapped the peptide linkers and accelerated the release of the antibiotic. An example that mimics the chemical and biological design of a natural secretory granule is the anionic microgel, composed of a 1:4 mole ratio of methylene-bis-acrylamide and methacrylic acid and loaded with the cationic anticancer drug, doxorubicin [37]. These microgels showed {\textgreater}300\% volume change when their {pH} was changed from 3.2 to 7.0 (diameter 6.5 μm) due to deprotonation of carboxyl groups. The coating of condensed microgel with a lipid membrane moved the design closer to a natural secretory granule but prevented {pH-responsive} volume expansion. A major challenge in the delivery of biotherapeutics is in developing strategies for overcoming lysosomal degradation of internalized drug molecules. Poly(propylacrylic acid), a {pH-responsive} polymer, disrupts cell membranes at low {pH} values prevailing in endosomes [38]. It was shown that a ternary complex of biotinylated {anti-CD3} antibody, streptavidin, and biotinylated polymer with a fluorescent label resulted in enhanced translocation to the cytoplasm of Jurkat cells. Again, as better designs evolve, inspiration comes from biology [39]. A “bioinspired {pH-responsive} polymer” is modified polyethylene glycol {(E3),} which can deliver the linked peptide to lysosome {(Figure} 2). The graft on {PEG} is a membrane-disruptive copolymer of methacrylate and acrylate. The {pH} drop after endocytosis hydrolyzes the acetal link between {PEG} and the copolymer. Here, the workers have chosen macrophages, a rather challenging system to work with. Successful manipulation of intracellular trafficking overcame a significant problem in the delivery of protein therapeutics and vaccines. The stimuli exploited in release systems include magnetic fields, ultrasonic radiation, electric fields, and presence of specific chemicals [13]. The release systems for naltrexone, amoxicillin, theophyllin, heparin, and calcitonin have been described [13]. The hydrogel-based products already available on the market target varied applications such as in hypertension, end-stage cancer pain, skin care, and wound and burn dressing [13]. One of the earliest applications of {poly(NIPAAm)} in biology was in the area of immunoassays [40]. Miyata et al. [41] synthesized an antigen-antibody semi-interpenetrating network {(semi-IPN)} hydrogel by the copolymerization of vinyl(rabbit {IgG)} (obtained by chemical reaction between {IgG} and N-succinimidylacrylate) and acrylamide, along with {N,N′-methylene} bisacrylamide as a crosslinker in the presence of polymerized goat anti-rabbit {IgG.} The presence of an external antigen leads to the disruption of the intrachain antigen-antibody binding by displacing the bound antigen with the external one, causing the gel to swell {(Figure} 3). The response was reversible and showed “shape-memory effect” as a consequence of {semi-IPN} structure. Design of such gels requires a tradeoff between rigidity (possible by dense crosslinking) and efficient analyte binding kinetics (shown by loose networks) [42]. In yet another emerging approach, molecular imprinting, by polymerizing stimuli-responsive hydrogel in the presence of the template, imparts analyte sensitivity to the gel and allows memorization of their binding conformation and to be switched on and off by control of the external stimulus [42]. The aims of gene therapy include curing genetic diseases and viral infections, slowing down tumor growth, and stopping neurodegenerative diseases [43]. As the basic principle is inserting the desired genetic material into the cell, finding an efficient method for the delivery of the gene and its sustained expression are crucial steps. While viral vectors are obvious choices and have been used most often so far, immune responses are a great obstacle. Two types of nonviral (synthetic) gene carriers, lipids and polymers, have been used. Both have to be cationic in nature in order to be able to form complexes with the anionic {DNA,} and the complex has to have net positive charge to interact with the anionic cell membrane and undergo endocytosis. The design has to conform to two contradictory requirements during endocytosis. While attaching to the cell and forming endosome, the binding between the carrier and the {DNA} has to be quite high. On the other hand, for {DNA} to move into the nucleus to initiate transcription, the complex should be easy to dissociate. It is here that stimuli-sensitive polymers are uniquely suited to fulfill the dual requirements, as the stimulus can control the binding to {DNA.} Furthermore, selective gene expression is possible in terms of site, timing, and duration by using temperature- or light-responsive polymers. The application of light-sensitive polymers is already illustrated by the use of L-lysine-modified polyazobenzene dendrimer for transfection of mammalian cells [44]. The temperature-responsive polymeric gene carrier utilizing {PNIPAAm} has also been described [45]. A copolymer with an {LCST} of {21°C} was mixed with a plasmid {DNA} encoding the β-galactosidase gene at {37°C,} added to the cells, and subjected to incubation for 3 hr at {20°C} after preincubation for 20 hr at {37°C.} The transfection efficiency was higher than the control, for which {20°C} incubation was missing {(Figure} 4). This was the time period when the carrier formed extended chains and released {DNA.} In an alternative design, the carrier had an {LCST} above body temperature, and heat was applied for dissociation of {DNA.} It may be added that ultrasonic devices allow temperature change with 5 mm precision. Another promising approach has been described by Stayton et al. [46], who found that pinocytosis of polylysine/poly(propylacrylic acid) nanoparticles could increase the transfection efficiency of polylysine/plasmid (expressing the green fluorescent protein) nanoparticles when both are taken up by {NIH3T3} fibroblast cells. Poly(propylacrylic acid) becomes membrane destabilizing as the endosomal {pH} drops. The approach is aimed at enhancing transport across endosomal membrane to get the {DNA} to the right intracellular compartment. A more recent work from the same group shows that the approach works only with late endosomes and not with lysosomes [47]. Also, analogs of the polymer-like poly(2-methylacrylic acid) and poly(2-ethylacrylic acid) are ineffective. Thus, smart polymers provide potential for considerable innovation in designs for nonviral vectors for gene therapy. This assumes extra significance in view of the recent finding that treatment of severe combined immunodeficiency disease with gene therapy based upon retroviral vector is suspected to be associated with cancer risk [48]. Tissue engineering is about delivery of appropriate cells for repair and/or development of new tissue by the use of scaffolds [1 and 49]. Smart hydrogels constitute promising materials for such scaffolds for two reasons. First, their interior environment is aqueous. Second, they can release the cells at the appropriate place in response to a suitable stimulus. The difficulty in sterilizing the loaded hydrogels is an unsolved problem [1]. It has been shown that {PNIPAAm} above {LCST} could attach chondrocytes and release them below {LCST} [49]. A potential application is in repair of damaged cartilage sites as in rheumatoid arthritis. The coculturing of rat hepatocytes and human lung fibroblasts on polystyrene grafted with {PNIPAAm} has been carried out with a view to model studies on cell-cell communication [50]. Polystyrene surfaces and temperature-controlled hydrophobicity of grafted polymers could pick up the two different types of cells selectively. Unlike in most of the other applications, the scaffolds for tissue engineering do not need to show the stimulus-dependent change in a reversible fashion. After the cells are delivered, one does not have to reverse the process. On the other hand, the biodegradability of the scaffold and lack of cytotoxicity and immunogenicity are the required traits [51]. It has also been realized that cells inside such scaffolds need effective cell-cell communications, and hence {3D} constructs of such scaffolds should have appropriate geometries. Many of these considerations once again have led workers to look at biological structures for inspiration. The result has been some very thought-provoking work with self-assembling structures based on peptides, lipids, or hybrid peptide materials. These synthetic peptides also permit incorporation of features that promote cell attachment [51]. An example of a self-assembling peptide is {RAD-16,} a self-complementary amphiphilic peptide [51]. By varying the concentration of the peptide or salt, the former could be assembled to form a hydrogel with the shape of a tape, rope, or sheet {(Figure} 5). Such scaffolds have already been shown to support cell attachment of various mammalian and avian tissue culture cells. Future work will have to address the issue of adequate mechanical strength and controlling cell growth with defined {3D} geometries. At present, the geometries of growing cell patterns can only be controlled in {2D} [52]. The ultimate challenge will, of course, lie in designing “scaffolds that influence cell adhesion, differentiation, and migration of specific cell types to create artificial tissues” [51]. Collier and Hessersmith [53] have designed a peptide that self-assembles into fibrillar structures and can further be crosslinked by transglutaminase. The attractive features of this design include the possibility of controlling transglutaminase action by Ca2+ concentration. While the N terminal of the peptide was susceptible to peptide action, the C terminal was tailored for cell attachment. The crosslinking imparted the mechanical strength just as disulphide crosslinks do in native proteins. The enzyme action can also be used in future for the decoration of these predominantly β-sheet fibrils with appropriate cell binding ligands or growth factors. The peptides described above do show some limited β-sheet structure even in the absence of salt concentration as a stimulus. The extent of this self-assembled structure becomes significant as the concentration of peptide increases. This may turn out to be a problem in real applications. It is not unlikely that a synergy of our understanding of synthetic hydrogels and such biomimetic structures would lead to the design of an ideal scaffold. The Hoffman group has developed the concept of conjugating a stimulus-responsive polymer/hydrogel to a protein at a site near its ligand recognition site [54]. The carefully controlled placement of the polymer ensures that when a stimulus is applied, the collapse/swelling of the gel causes the active site of the protein to be blocked/“gated” or unblocked. This can also lead to the release of a small molecular weight ligand from the active site of the protein. In most of the cases, the polymer chosen is {poly(NIPAAm),} and frequently streptavidin (quite often suitably altered by protein engineering) has been the protein used. In one of the early examples, {poly(NIPAAm)} was linked to streptavidin at a site located just above its biotin binding site [54]. When the temperature is raised above the {LCST} of the hydrogel, it collapses, covering the active site. Biotin can no longer bind to streptavidin, thus the polymer effectively acts as a “molecular gate.” Ding et al. [55] have conjugated {poly(NIPAAm)} to a site near a genetically engineered streptavidin that is involved in binding to biotin and is responsible for favoring the streptavidin-biotin interaction. Temperature-induced collapse of the polymer leads to the release of the bound molecule above its {LCST.} Thus, this streptavidin-polymer conjugate can act as a “trigger” for the release of biotin. Using {pH} as the stimulus can also bring about the release of biotin. In this case, a copolymer of acrylic acid and {NIPAAm} is conjugated to a genetically engineered streptavidin at a site near its biotin binding site. Changing the {pH} of the solution brought about the triggered release of biotin. In a novel manner of exploiting this approach, Ding et al. [56] have used the thermally sensitive polymer, {poly(N,N-diethylacrylamide),} and attached it to streptavidin at a site near the biotin binding site. Below its {LCST} {(24°C),} the polymer is in an extended coil conformation, thus acting as a “shield” and preventing the binding of the biotinylated protein to streptavidin. Using polymers of different sizes, one can control size selectivity of the shields. Hence, these shields can be used to discriminate among a mixture of biotinylated proteins on the basis of size. Collapse of the polymer upon increasing the temperature leads to exposure of the biotin binding site. In a logical extension of this concept to thermal switching of enzyme activity, control of endoglucanase activity by site-directed conjugation of another acrylamide copolymer near the enzyme active site has been described recently [57]. This paper may also be consulted for some strategies for designing molecular switches, including some recent work on {RNA} switches and a redox switch for an endonuclease. The concept of physical blocking of recognition sites by a collapsed form has also been utilized in design of photoswitches for ligand association. This has been shown to work with binding of biotin to streptavidin conjugate of a photoresponsive acrylamide-acrylate copolymer [58]. In a parallel work, photoregulation of endoglucanase activity by conjugation with the same copolymer has also been described [59]. Such molecular switches might be useful in bioprocessing, biosensors, prodrug therpeutic applications, and microfluidics. With a goal to design composite systems by self-assembly for molecular switching, {PNIPAAm} and copolymers were also studied as adsorption layer on colloidal silica [60]. In the restricted geometry of the adsorbed layer, the phase transition was broader than in solution. In the case of the copolymer, {NMR} showed comparatively mobile arrangement even above the transition temperature, which was rightly interpreted in terms of electrostatic repulsion between the matrix and the polymer hindering globule formation. Another interesting recent discovery has been that smart polymers seem to simulate molecular chaperones to assist in correct protein folding [61]. Molecular chaperones act by binding to the protein folding intermediates with exposed hydrophobic residues, thus preventing aggregation and facilitating correct folded structure [62]. The smartness of the polymer is valuable, as the overall hydrophobicity of smart polymers can be varied by applying the appropriate stimulus. Also, it is possible to recycle the polymer by dissociating it from the folded protein molecule. Lin et al. [63] found that {PNIPAAm} increased the final yield of enzyme activity during renaturation of β-lactamase from its inclusion bodies. The presence of the polymer did not affect the initial renaturation rate, and the final yield increased with temperature. The latter is in agreement with the assumption that hydrophobicity of the polymer helps in protein folding. In a more recent work by the same group [64] but with guanidine hydrochloride-denatured carbonic anhydrase B, it was confirmed by fluorescence analysis and equilibrium studies that {PNIPAAm} enhances “protein refolding by the formation of complexes with aggregation-prone folding intermediates via hydrophobic interactions.” An optimal molar ratio of polymer to enzyme was found, since higher polymer concentration led to protein precipitation. These workers also showed that addition of {PNIPAAm} after enzyme aggregation has taken place (within 1 min) did not lead to correct protein folding. Under optimum conditions, a refolding yield of 98.2\% was reported. Kuboi et al. [61] showed that the presence of a thermoresponsive polymer, {PPO-Ph-PEG} {[PEG} containing poly(propylene oxide)phenyl group], increased the refolding yield of (guanidine-hydrochloride-denatured) carbonic anhydrase 1.7 times. It was also found that the polymer/dextran system increased the refolding yield of the enzyme as compared to the {PEG/dextran} system. The fact that {52°C} was found to be optimal for this process was significant since (1) local hydrophobicity of the protein increased from {40°C} onward, reached maximum around {60°C,} and then declined, and (2) local hydrophobicity of the polymer {PPO-Ph-PEG} increased gradually with increasing temperature till {45°C,} increased sharply at this phase transition temperature, and ultimately reached a plateau beyond {45°C.} Thus, {52°C,} within the two values of {45°C} and {60°C,} presumably reflects the optimum interaction between the hydrophobic sites on the polymer and the enzyme. After the enzyme is refolded to native state, it is released from its complex with the polymer, since the folded protein has far less local hydrophobicity. Somewhat similar results have been obtained by Umakoshi et al. [65] while using a two-phase system consisting of a thermosensitive polymer, Breox (a random copolymer of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide), and dextran or a Breox/water system. It was found that unfolded chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 with a more hydrophobic surface partitioned to the relatively hydrophobic Breox phase in both systems. The inhibitor could be refolded in Breox phase and separated from it by precipitating out the polymer by increasing the temperature. These investigations certainly help in gaining insight into the role of chaperones in protein folding and evolving efficient protein recovery protocols, especially in the case of many overexpressed proteins (inclusion bodies) in Escherischia coli. The concept of lab-in-a-chip has evolved out of efforts to miniaturize analytical instruments. By using photolithography on a chip, one can create microchannels and work with very small volumes. As Mitchell [66] wrote, {“Functional} complexity brings with it a need to actively switch and control fluids, to change their flow rate and direction at different points on the chip at different stages of the process.” Smart materials show considerable promise in designing microactuators for autonomous flow control inside these microfluidic channels. Saitoh et al. [67] have explored the use of glass capillaries coated with {PNIPAAm} for creating an on/off valve for the liquid flow. Below {LCST,} the {PNIPAAm-coated} capillary {(PNIPAAm} enhances the wettability at these temperatures) allowed the flow of water; above {LCST,} the flow was blocked as the coating was now hydrophobic. Beebe et al. [68], on the other hand, used a {pH-sensitive} methacrylate to control the flow inside the microchannels. The hydrogel-based microfluidic valve opened or closed depending upon the {pH} of the flowing solution. The design has the potential of being self-regulating/autonomous since the valve can be controlled by feedback by H+ produced or consumed in the reaction. A good response time of less than 10 s was reported. Undoubtedly, we will see many other innovative designs for such applications in the coming years. In this review, we have provided only a glimpse into the complexities and utility of smart polymeric biomaterials; however, with this snapshot we have strived to illustrate the versatility and potential of these materials. Indeed, one could postulate that the versatility of smart materials is limited only by the imaginations of their designers and by the scientists who use them. Interestingly, a recently published article discussing the “intelligence” of smart materials hypothesized that if current smart materials were rated using a standard {IQ} test, they would have an {IQ} of 2 [69]—impressive for inanimate compounds. And researchers are continuing to develop smarter, more useful compounds—we like to think that we are getting closer to designing T-1000 (the robot from Terminator 2: Judgment Day that changes from solid to liquid) [70]. One may question the reasoning of our goal of developing novel smart polymers to perform chemical and biological functions, since existing natural compounds can already meet these needs. We argue that purposefully designed biomaterials offer additional attractions such as predictability (a designed artificial polymer is a known entity) as well as an improved ability to manipulate desirable (and undesirable) traits present in assays. Drug design and medicine will profit both financially and in terms of providing high quality health care, with the ability to precisely craft artificial organs and drug delivery vehicles that “intelligently” interface with cells and organs. An area of key interest to the smart polymeric biomaterial field is the immune system. For example, using smart materials one could imagine ways to regulate the immune response to control hypersensitivity without impairing the overall immune system. Smart materials are poised for take off and will certainly promise an exciting future at the interface of chemistry and biology.

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations are used to probe the properties of non-native states of the protein human [alpha]-lactalbumin (human {[alpha]-LA)} with a detailed atomistic model in an implicit aqueous solvent environment. To sample the conformational space, a biasing force is introduced that increases the radius of gyration relative to the native state and generates a large number of low-energy conformers that differ in terms of their root-mean-square deviation, for a given radius of gyration. The resulting structures are relaxed by unbiased simulations and used as models of the molten globule and partly denatured states of human {[alpha]-LA,} based on measured radii of gyration obtained from nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. The ensembles of structures agree in their overall properties with experimental data available for the human {[alpha]-LA} molten globule and its more denatured states. In particular, the simulation results show that the native-like fold of the [alpha]-domain is preserved in the molten globule. Further, a considerable proportion of the antiparallel [beta]-strand in the [beta]-domain are present. This indicates that the lack of hydrogen exchange protection found experimentally for the [beta]-domain is due to rearrangement of the [beta]-sheet involving transient populations of non-native [beta]-structures. The simulations also provide details concerning the ensemble of structures that contribute as the molten globule unfolds and shows, in accord with experimental data, that unfolding is not cooperative; i.e. the various structural elements do not unfold simultaneously.},

The Donnan contribution accounts for electroneutrality in a multicomponent solution of (poly)electrolytes. The importance of distinguishing this ideal contribution to B2 is emphasized, thereby allowing us to model the interaction part of B2 by molecular computations. The model for protein-protein interactions that we use here extends earlier work {(Neal} et al., 1998) by accounting for long-range electrostatic interactions and the specific hydration of the protein by strongly associated water molecules. Our model predictions are compared with measurements of B2 for lysozyme at {25°C} over {pH} from 5.0 to 9.0, and 7-60 {mM} ionic strength. We find that B2 is positive at all solution conditions and decreases with increasing ionic strength, as expected, whereas the interaction part of B2 is negative at all conditions and becomes progressively less negative with increasing ionic strength. Although long-range electrostatic interactions dominate this contribution, particularly at low ionic strength, short-range electrostatic/dispersion interactions with specific hydration are essential for an accurate description of B2 derived from experiment.},

Yet, little is understood about protein interaction with such media at the molecular level, or how different media architectures might affect separation performance. To gain a better understanding of such adsorptive systems, statistical mechanical perturbation calculations, utilizing a {Debye-Huckel} potential, were performed on surface-grafted charged polymers and their interaction with model proteins. The studied systems were weakly charged, and the polymers were linear and relatively short (degree of polymerization is 30). Segment distributions from the surface were also determined. The interaction of spherical model protein particles of 12-30 angstrom radius were investigated with respect to polymer grafting density, distance from matrix surface, protein charge, and ionic strength. The partitioning coefficient of the model proteins was determined for different distances from the surface. An empirical mean field theory that scales the entropy of the protein with the square of the protein radius correlates well to Monte Carlo statistical modeling results. Upon adsorption to the polymer layers, the model proteins exhibit a critical surface charge density that is proportional to the ionic strength, independent of the grafting density, and appears to be a fundamental determinant of protein adsorption. Partitioning of protein-like nanoparticles to the charged polymer surface is only favored above the particle critical charge density.},

	abstract = {Multiple R-groups (monovalent fragments) are implicitly accessible within most of the molecular structures that populate large structural databases. R-group searching would desirably consider {pIC50} contribution forecasts as well as ligand similarities or docking scores. However, R-group searching, with or without {pIC50} forecasts, is currently not practical. The most prevalent and reliable source of {pIC50} predictions, existing {3D-QSAR} approaches, is also difficult and somewhat subjective. Yet in 25 of 25 trials on data sets on which a field-based {3D-QSAR} treatment had already succeeded, substitution of objective (canonically generated) topomer poses for the original structure-guided manual alignments produced acceptable {3D-QSAR} models, on average having almost equivalent statistical quality to the published models, and with negligible effort. Their overall {pIC50} prediction error is 0.805, calculated as the average over these 25 topomer {CoMFA} models in the standard deviations of {pIC50} predictions, derived from the 1109 possible {“leave-out-one-R-group”} {(LOORG)} {pIC50} contributions. {(This} novel {LOORG} protocol provides a more realistic and stringent test of prediction accuracy than the customary “leave-out-one-compound” {LOO} approach.) The associated average predictive r2 of 0.495 indicates a {pIC50} prediction accuracy roughly halfway between perfect and useless. To assess the ability of {topomer-CoMFA} based virtual screening to identify “highly active” R-groups, a Receiver Operating Curve {(ROC)} approach was adopted. Using, as the binary criterion for a “highly active” R-group, a predicted {pIC50} greater than the top 25\% of the observed {pIC50} range, the {ROC} area averaged across the 25 topomer {CoMFA} models is 0.729. Conventionally interpreted, the odds that a “highly active” R-group will indeed confer such a high {pIC50} are 0.729/(1−0.729) or almost 3 to 1. To confirm that virtual screening within large collections of realized structures would provide a useful quantity and variety of R-group suggestions, combining shape similarity with the “highly active” {pIC50,} the 50 searches provided by these 25 models were applied to 2.2 million structurally distinct R-group candidates among 2.0 million structures within a {ZINC} database, identifying an average of 5705 R-groups per search, with the highest predicted {pIC50} combination averaging 1.6 log units greater than the highest reported {pIC50s.}},

In this article, the authors define this new field. First, they review the {"Grid} problem," which is defined as flexible, secure, coordinated resource sharing among dynamic collections of individuals, institutions, and resources--what is referred to as virtual organizations. In such settings, unique authentication, authorization, resource access, resource discovery, and other challenges are encountered. It is this class of problem that is addressed by Grid technologies. Next, the authors present an extensible and open Grid architecture, in which protocols, services, application programming interfaces, and software development kits are categorized according to their roles in enabling resource sharing. The authors describe requirements that they believe any such mechanisms must satisfy and discuss the importance of defining a compact set of intergrid protocols to enable interoperability among different Grid systems. Finally, the authors discuss how Grid technologies relate to other contemporary technologies, including enterprise integration, application service provider, storage service provider, and peer-to-peer computing. They maintain that Grid concepts and technologies complement and have much to contribute to these other approaches.},

Application to a training set of 594 compounds led to a correlation equation with a standard deviation, {SD,} of 0.56 log units.

The correlation equations enable the factors that influence aqueous solubility to be revealed. The hydrogen-bond propensity of a compound always leads to an increase in solubility, even though the Sigma {alpha(2)(H)} X Sigma {beta(2)(H)} term opposes solubility due to interactions in the liquid or solid. Increase in solute dipolarity/polarizability increases solubility, whereas an increase in solute excess molar refraction, and especially, volume decrease solubility.

	volume = {113},
	abstract = {A novel Monte Carlo technique, the rebridging configurational-bias {(RCB)} method, has been developed to rearrange inner sections of chain molecules having strong intramolecular interactions along the backbone. The ability of sampling inner chain segments is important for the simulation of systems with low concentration of chain ends, such as polymers and molecules with cyclic structures. In the {RCB} method, inner segments are removed and then regrown site-by-site in a configurational-bias fashion. However, a short preliminary simulation is carried out to calculate weighting functions based on histograms of the separation distance between pairs of sites along the chain; these functions are used to bias the trial positions of growing inner sites so as to promote efficient chain closure. A look-ahead search scheme is employed for the sampling of the last two sites to increase the overall acceptance rate of the reconstruction process. The validity and performance of the new algorithm were tested by studying linear alkane systems of various chain lengths. Fast conformational equilibration was observed, from the level of local bond orientations to the level of the chain end-to-end vector orientations. Cyclic alkanes containing from 8 to 100 carbon atoms were also studied by using the {RCB} method. Our results for the conformational properties of cyclooctane are generally consistent with previous molecular dynamics {(MD)} results and with experimental data. The vapor-liquid coexistence curve of cyclooctane was also mapped out by using the {RCB} method in conjunction with a histogram reweighting technique for the analysis of isothermal-isobaric simulations. {(C)} 2000 American Institute of Physics. {[S0021-9606(00)51848-0].}},

	abstract = {We present the first global parameterization and validation of a novel charge model, called {AM1-BCC,} which quickly and efficiently generates high-quality atomic charges for computer simulations of organic molecules in polar media. The goal of the charge model is to produce atomic charges that emulate the {HF/6-31G*} electrostatic potential {(ESP)} of a molecule. Underlying electronic structure features, including formal charge and electron delocalization, are first captured by {AM1} population charges; simple additive bond charge corrections {(BCCs)} are then applied to these {AM1} atomic charges to produce the {AM1-BCC} charges. The parameterization of {BCCs} was carried out by fitting to the {HF/6-31G*} {ESP} of a training set of {\textgreater}2700 molecules. Most organic functional groups and their combinations were sampled, as well as an extensive variety of cyclic and fused bicyclic heteroaryl systems. The resulting {BCC} parameters allow the {AM1-BCC} charging scheme to handle virtually all types of organic compounds listed in The Merck Index and the {NCI} Database. Validation of the model was done through comparisons of hydrogen-bonded dimer energies and relative free energies of solvation using {AM1-BCC} charges in conjunction with the 1994 Cornell et al. forcefield for {AMBER.13} Homo- and hetero-dimer hydrogen-bond energies of a diverse set of organic molecules were reproduced to within 0.95 kcal/mol {RMS} deviation from the ab initio values, and for {DNA} dimers the energies were within 0.9 kcal/mol {RMS} deviation from ab initio values. The calculated relative free energies of solvation for a diverse set of monofunctional isosteres were reproduced to within 0.69 kcal/mol of experiment. In all these validation tests, {AMBER} with the {AM1-BCC} charge model maintained a correlation coefficient above 0.96. Thus, the parameters presented here for use with the {AM1-BCC} method present a fast, accurate, and robust alternative to {HF/6-31G*} {ESP-fit} charges for general use with the {AMBER} force field in computer simulations involving organic small molecules.

	abstract = {As a popular tool in exploring free energy landscapes, the metadynamics method has been widely applied to elucidate various chemical or biochemical processes. As deeply discussed by Laio et al. {[J.} Phys. Chem. B 109, 6714 (2005)], the size of the updating Gaussian function is pivotal to the free energy convergence toward the target free energy surface. For instance, a greater Gaussian height can facilitate the quick visit of a conformation region of interest; however, it may lead to a larger error of the calculated free energy surface. In contrast, a lower Gaussian height can guarantee a better resolution of the calculated free energy surface; however, it will take longer time for such a simulation to navigate through the defined conformational region. In order to reconcile such confliction, the authors present a method by implementing the {Wang-Landau} recursion scheme in the metadynamics simulations to adaptively update the height of the unit Gaussian function. As demonstrated in their model studies on both a toy system, and a realistic molecular system treated with the hybrid quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical {(QM/MM)} potential, the present approach can quickly result in more decently converged free energy surfaces, compared with the classical metadynamics simulations employing the fixed Gaussian heights.},

Here, we illustrate the practical importance of pfold and demonstrate how it can be determined theoretically. We derive a general analytical expression for pfold and show how it can be estimated from simulations for systems where the transition rates between the relevant microstates are not known. By analyzing the Ising model we are able to determine the scaling behavior of the numerical error in the pfold estimate as function of the number of analyzed Monte Carlo runs. We apply our method to a simple, newly developed protein folding model for the formation of alpha helices. It is demonstrated that our technique highly parallelizes the calculation of pfold and that it is orders of magnitude more efficient than conventional approaches.},

The solvation free energy of a small molecule provides a surrogate to the desolvation of the ligand in the thermodynamic process of protein−ligand binding. Here, we use explicit solvent molecular dynamics free energy perturbation to predict the absolute solvation free energies of a set of 239 small molecules, spanning diverse chemical functional groups commonly found in drugs and drug-like molecules. We also compare the performance of absolute solvation free energies obtained using the {OPLS\_2005} force field with two other commonly used small molecule force fields—general {AMBER} force field {(GAFF)} with {AM1-BCC} charges and {CHARMm-MSI} with {CHelpG} charges. Using the {OPLS\_2005} force field, we obtain high correlation with experimental solvation free energies {(R2} = 0.94) and low average unsigned errors for a majority of the functional groups compared to {AM1-BCC/GAFF} or {CHelpG/CHARMm-MSI.} However, {OPLS\_2005} has errors of over 1.3 kcal/mol for certain classes of polar compounds. We show that predictions on these compound classes can be improved by using a semiempirical charge assignment method with an implicit bond charge correction.},

Accordingly, new antivirals directed at the M2 and neuraminidase proteins, and against the hemagglutinin protein, are being developed. In addition, elucidation of the structural basis for several crucial functions of other viral proteins (specifically the non-structural {NS1A} protein, the nucleoprotein and the viral polymerase) has identified novel targets for the development of new antivirals.

	abstract = {{F1Fo-ATP} synthase is the enzyme responsible for most of the {ATP} synthesis in living systems. The catalytic domain F1 of the {F1Fo} complex, {F1-ATPase,} has the ability to hydrolyze {ATP.} A fundamental problem in the development of a detailed mechanism for this enzyme is that it has not been possible to determine experimentally the relation between the ligand binding affinities measured in solution and the different conformations of the catalytic [beta] subunits {([beta]TP,} {[beta]DP,} {[beta]E)} observed in the crystal structures of the mitochondrial enzyme, {MF1.} Using free energy difference simulations for the hydrolysis reaction {ATP} {H2O} [right-arrow] {ADP} Pi in the {[beta]TP} and {[beta]DP} sites and unisite hydrolysis data, we are able to identify {[beta]TP} as the "tight" {(KD} = 10[-]12 M, {MF1)} binding site for {ATP} and {[beta]DP} as the "loose" site. An energy decomposition analysis demonstrates how certain residues, some of which have been shown to be important in catalysis, modulate the free energy of the hydrolysis reaction in the {[beta]TP} and {[beta]DP} sites, even though their structures are very similar. Combined with the recently published simulations of the rotation cycle of {F1-ATPase,} the present results make possible a consistent description of the binding change mechanism of {F1-ATPase} at an atomic level of detail. 10.1073/pnas.0337432100},

The model utilizes the Buckingham exponential-6 potential to describe the nonbonded interaction energy. Histogram reweighting grand canonical Monte Carlo methods were used to determine the model parameters. The new model reproduces the experimental saturated liquid and vapor densities and vapor pressures for ethane through octane to within average absolute deviations of 0.5\%, 2.1\%, and 2.2\% respectively. Critical temperatures and densities were also found to be in good agreement with experiment. Critical pressures are slightly overestimated for longer chain lengths.

The two previous models reproduce the liquid properties with comparable accuracy to the proposed model; however, the new model was found to describe the vapor pressures more accurately. Liquid densities were determined for the new model for chain lengths as long as C-78 Agreement to experiment is within 1\% at atmospheric pressure.

	abstract = {The adsorption kinetics of myoglobin in charged gels of varying agarose content have been measured macroscopically, through batch uptake experiments, and microscopically, using light microscopy with gels supported in microfluidics chips. The apparent effective pore diffusivities, determined by fitting either set of rate data to the shrinking core model, were greater than the free solution diffusivity and concentration-dependent. Moreover, the microscopically derived concentration profiles were qualitatively different from the predicted ones. Therefore, a new model taking into account an assumed favorable partitioning of the protein in the pore liquid is proposed to describe the adsorption kinetics. The new model yields effective pore diffusivities that are in approximate agreement with the values determined chromatographically under nonbinding conditions and with hindered diffusion theory. In addition, it predicts concentration profiles in the gel that are consistent with those observed microscopically. The overall increase in mass transfer is attributed to the favorable partitioning of the protein in the pores at low ionic strength, which results in a greater diffusional driving force. © 2008 American Institute of Chemical Engineers {AIChE} J, 2009},

Individual substituent groups tend to have consistent effects {onK,} permitting the extraction of incremental free energies {(d?F),} enthalpies {(d?H),} and entropies {(d?S)} of partition and of solution. Values of the selectivity constants and of {d?Fl} for the {-CH2-and} {-OH} groups in lecithin suggest that partitioned solutes are mainly located in a region slightly less hydrophobic than octanol and similar to {C5H11OH} in its solvent properties. Lecithin discriminates against branched solutes more than does a bulk solvent with the sames value. Below the endothermic phase-transition temperature (i.e., when the hydrocarbon tails “freeze”), {?S} and {?H} of partition increase {10-fold,K} jumps down slightly, {?S} and {?H} of solution reverse in sign from negative to positive, and the {Barclay-Butler} constants become more positive. Partition in lecithin and in erythrocytes is similar, except for the absence of surface charge effects in lecithin. Resistance to nonelectrolyte permeation is inhomogeneously distributed through the bilayer, and the region of maximum partition does not provide the rate-limiting barrier. An appendix derives a simple general expression for the nonelectrolyte permeability of a membrane that may be asymmetrical, may have position-dependent partition coefficients and diffusion coefficients, and may have significant interfacial resistances.},

	abstract = {Two-dimensional adaptive umbrella sampling with the first umbrella coordinate equal to the potential energy of the system and the second umbrella coordinate equal to a function that discriminates important folded conformations from unfolded conformations is used to determine the equilibrium properties of complex biological systems. Compared to one-dimensional adaptive umbrella sampling with the potential energy as umbrella coordinate (multicanonical sampling), more reliable results can be obtained in certain cases. The method is applied to a helical peptide {(RN24)} with an analytical continuum solvent potential in combination with the {PARAM19} force field of {CHARMM.} This effective potential energy function has been shown to describe the structural preferences of solvated peptides. With the two-dimensional approach and the deviation from the helical structure as the second umbrella coordinate, a converged description of the structural properties and the thermodynamics of the peptide {RN24} is obtained. In particular, we find that the formation of the helix of {RN24} occurs as a transition accompanied by a characteristic peak in the heat capacity. A formalism is described that uses the weighting factors obtained from a self-consistent solution of the weighted histogram analysis method equations to combine the results from a series of simulations with different biases and calculate the ensemble average of any dynamical variable as a function of the temperature without the need for extracting the density of states from the simulations. It is shown how the formalism can be used to calculate thermodynamic properties of the system. {(C)} 1999 American Institute of Physics. {[S0021-9606(99)50340-1].}},

Borrowing from well-understood zinc-binding motifs in proteins, thiol and imidazole moieties were positioned within the peptoid such that both helices must align in close proximity to form a binding site. We used fluorescence resonance energy transfer {(FRET)} reporter groups to measure the change of the distance between the two helical segments and to probe the binding of zinc. We systematically varied the position and number of zinc-binding residues, as well as the sequence and size of the loop that connects the two helical segments. We found that certain peptoid two-helix bundles bind zinc with nanomolar affinities and high selectivity compared to other divalent metal ions.

The library for each fragment can be Boltzmann distributed and thus account for all correlations internal to the fragment. {LBMC} can be applied to both atomistic and coarse-grained models, as we demonstrate in this “proof-of-principle” report. We first verify the approach in a toy model and in implicitly solvated all-atom polyalanine systems. We next study five proteins, up to 309 residues in size. On the basis of atomistic equilibrium libraries of peptide-plane configurations, the proteins are modeled with fully atomistic backbones and simplified Go̅-like interactions among residues. We show that full equilibrium sampling can be obtained in days to weeks on a single processor, suggesting that more accurate models are well within reach. For the future, {LBMC} provides a convenient platform for constructing adjustable or mixed-resolution models: the configurations of all atoms can be stored at no run-time cost, while an arbitrary subset of interactions is “turned on”.},

Results show that at low temperature. where the harmonic approximation holds, the {Nose'-Hoover} {(NH)} thermostat fails to reproduce the statistical mechanical behavior, even using simulation lengths of millions of time steps, whereas the Gaussian isokinetic {(IG)} thermostat reproduces quite well the expected statistical mechanical values. The Berendsen's coupling {(BC)} provides good results for basic properties such as the average potential and kinetic energies but fails in reproducing the canonical fluctuations. Moreover, using the speed of divergence of initially nearby trajectories in phase space as a measure of the dynamical chaoticity, we found that the {NH} thermostat provides very slow divergence for the physical phase space degrees of freedom, concentrating most of its chaoticity in the dynamics of the thermostat virtual degree of freedom. On the contrary, the {IG} thermostat provides always highly diverging trajectories in phase space, characterized by a high chaoticity of each degree of freedom. Finally, the {BC} thermostat provides a moderate chaotic behavior for all of the degrees of freedom. Such results suggest that even assuming for both the “rigorous” algorithms {(NH} and {IG)} a full ergodic behavior the {NH} thermostat could require an extremely long time to achieve convergence of the time averaged properties. {KeyWords} Plus: {MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS;} {HAMILTONIAN-SYSTEMS;} {CANONICAL} {ENSEMBLE;} {SIMULATIONS;} {EQUILIBRIUM;} {ERGODICITY;} {PROTEINS;} {FREEDOM;} {ALKANES;} {TIMES}},

These antibodies are stored for long durations under high concentrations as required in the disease treatment. Unfortunately, these antibodies aggregate under these storage conditions, leading to a decrease in antibody activity and raising concerns about causing an immunological response. Thus, there is a tremendous need to identify the aggregation-prone regions in different classes of antibodies. We use the {SAP} (spatial-aggregation-propensity) technology based on molecular simulations to determine the aggregation-prone motifs in the constant regions of {IgG1} classes of antibodies. Mutations engineered on these aggregation-prone motif regions led to antibodies of enhanced stability. Fourteen aggregation-prone motifs are identified, with each motif containing one to seven residues. While some of these motifs contain residues that are neighbors in primary sequence, others contain residues that are far apart in primary sequence but are close together in the tertiary structure. Comparison of the {IgG1} sequence with those of other subclasses {(IgG2,} {IgG3} and {IgG4)} showed that these aggregation-prone motifs are largely preserved among all {IgG} subclasses. Other broader classes of antibodies {(IgA1,} {IgD,} {IgE} and {IgM),} however, differed in these motif regions. The aggregation-prone motifs identified were therefore common to all {IgG} subclasses, but differ from those of {non-IgG} classes. Moreover, since the motifs identified are in the constant regions, they are applicable for all antibodies within the {IgG} class irrespective of the variable region. Thus, the motif regions identified could be modified on all {IgGs} to yield antibodies of enhanced stability.},

Phys. 23, 356 (1955)] into the Jarzynski nonequilibrium work {(NEW)} free-energy calculation technique {[C.} Jarzynski, Phys. Rev. Lett. 78, 2690 (1997)]. The proposed hybrid modifies the way steps are taken in the {NEW} process. With it, each step is selected from a range of alternatives, with bias given to steps that contribute the least work. The definition of the work average is modified to account for the bias. We introduce two variants of this method, lambda-bias sampling and configuration-bias sampling, respectively; a combined lambda- and configuration-bias method is also considered. By reducing the likelihood that large nonequilibrated work values enter the ensemble average, the Rosenbluth sampling aids in remedying problems of inaccuracy of the calculation. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods through a model system of N independent harmonic oscillators. This model captures the difficulties involved in calculating free energies in real systems while retaining many tractable features that are helpful to the study. We examine four variants of this model that differ qualitatively in the nature of their phase-space overlap. Results indicate that the lambda-bias sampling method is most useful for systems with entropic sampling barriers, while the configuration-bias methods are best for systems with energetic sampling barriers. The Rosenbluth-sampling schemes yield much more accurate results than the unbiased nonequilibrium work method. Typically the accuracy can be improved by about an order of magnitude for a given amount of sampling; this improvement translates into two or more orders of magnitude less sampling required to obtain a given level of accuracy, owing to the generally slow convergence of the {NEW} calculation when the inaccuracy is large.},

First of all, we introduce simple statistical mechanics models which display, in the thermodynamic limit, folding and related transitions. These models can be divided into (i) crude spin glass-like models (with their Mattis analogs), where one may look for possible correlations between the chain self-interactions and the folded structure, (ii) glass-like models, where one emphasizes the geometrical competition between one- or two-dimensional local order (mimicking alpha helix or beta sheet structures), and the requirement of global compactness. Both models are too simple to predict the spatial organization of a realistic protein, but are useful for the physicist and should have some feedback in other glassy systems (glasses, collapsed polymers,⋯). These remarks lead us to the second physical approach, namely a new {Monte-Carlo} method, where one grows the protein atom-by-atom (or residue-by-residue), using a standard form {(CHARMM,⋯)} for the total energy. A detailed comparison with other {Monte-Carlo} schemes, or Molecular Dynamics calculations, is then possible; we will sketch such a comparison for poly-alanines. Our twofold approach illustrates some of the difficulties one encounters in the protein folding problem, in particular those associated with the existence of a large number of metastable states.},

	abstract = {The ligand-protein docking algorithm based on the mining minima method has been substantially enhanced. First, the basic algorithm is accelerated by: (1) adaptively determining the extent of each energy well to help avoid previously discovered energy minima; (2) biasing the search away from ligand positions at the surface of the receptor to prevent the ligand from staying at the surface when large sampling regions are used; (3) quickly testing multiple different ligand positions and orientations for each ligand conformation; and (4) tuning the source code to increase computational efficiency. These changes markedly shorten the time needed to discover an accurate result, especially when large sampling regions are used. The algorithm now also allows user-selected receptor sidechains to be treated as mobile during the docking procedure. The energies associated with the mobile side chains are computed as if they belonged to the ligand, except that atoms at the boundary between side chains and the rigid backbone are treated specially. This new capability is tested for several well-known ligand/protein systems, and preliminary application to an enzyme whose substrate is unknown-the recently solved hypothetical protein {YecO} {(HI0319)} from Haemophilus influenzae-indicates that side-chains relaxations allow candidate substrates of various sizes to be accommodated.

All calculations are performed for the ”zero sum” model system of ”ethane-to-ethane” in water. The symmetry of the change in this system allows one to unambiguously evaluate the approach to convergence for a series of simulations. The results of these calculations indicate that (1) using {FEP,} the single topology approach is more efficient than the dual topology approach for all but very long simulations; (2) using {TI,} the single topology approach is considerably more efficient than the dual topology approach for relatively short simulations, while the two methods are of comparable efficiency for long Simulations; and (3) {TI} and {FEP} are comparably efficient with the single topology technique, but {TI} is more efficient when the dual topology method is used.

Choices are considered in which w(u)=1 {and⅟cosh[(u-C)/2];} the latter being Bennett's method where C is a parameter that can be selected arbitrarily, and may be used to optimize the precision of the calculation. We examine the methods in several applications: calculation of the pressure of a square-well fluid by perturbing the volume, the chemical potential of a high-density {Lennard-Jones} system, and the chemical potential of a model for water. We find that the approaches based on Bennett's method weighting are very effective at ensuring an accurate result (one in which the systematic error arising from inadequate sampling is less than the estimated confidence limits), and that even the selection w(u)=1 offers marked improvement over comparable methods. We suggest that Bennett's method is underappreciated, and the benefits it offers for improved precision and (especially) accuracy are substantial, and therefore it should be more widely used. {(C)} 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

Starting from a computer model proven to reproduce the physical properties of such a complex system, the permeation of small organic molecules across a lipid bilayer model has been studied. Free energy profiles and diffusion coefficients along the bilayer normal have been calculated for small organic molecules by means of all-atom molecular dynamics {(MD)} simulations constraining the compounds at chosen depths inside the membrane. These data also allow for the calculation of permeability coefficients, the results for which have been compared with experimental data.

The transport mechanisms were investigated by using three probe molecules: nitrogen, water, and toluene. While a barrier effect appears clearly with nitrogen, this effect changes with the amount of fillers for water and disappears for toluene. The reduction of permeability for nitrogen is mainly due to the increase of tortuosity. For water and toluene, the permeation kinetics reveals many concomitant phenomena responsible for the permeation behavior. Despite the tortuosity effect, the toluene permeability of nanocomposites increases with {C30B} fraction. The water and toluene molecules interact differently with fillers according to their hydrophilic/hydrophobic character. Moreover, the plasticization effect of water and toluene in the matrix, involving a concentration-dependent diffusion coefficient, is correctly described by the law D = {D0eγC.} On the basis of Nielsen’s tortuosity concept, we suggest a new approach for relative permeability modeling, not only based on the geometrical parameters (aspect ratio, orientation, recovery) but also including phenomenological parameters deduced from structural characterization and permeation kinetics.},

Because of the emergence of time oscillations near the Hopf bifurcation, the resonance spectrum turns out to be complex and defined by both relaxation rates and oscillation frequencies. The resonance spectrum is discrete far from the bifurcation and becomes continuous at the bifurcation. This continuous spectrum is caused by the critical slowing down of the oscillations occurring at the Hopf bifurcation and it leads to power-law relaxation as⅟roott of the probability densities and statistical averages at long times t―{\textgreater}infinity.

A single molecular dynamics simulation of a judiciously chosen reference state (using two sets of soft-core interactions) is sufficient to determine conformational distributions of chemically similar compounds and the free energy differences between them. The {ES-OS} method is applied to a set of five biologically relevant 8-substituted {GTP} analogs having high energy barriers between the anti and the syn conformations of the base with respect to the ribose part. The reliability of {ES-OS} is verified by comparing the results to Hamiltonian replica exchange simulations of {GTP} and {8-Br-GTP} and the experimentally determined {3J(C4,H1′)} coupling constant for {GMP} in water. Additional simulations in vacuum and octanol allow us to calculate differences in the solvation free energies and in lipophilicities (log P). Free energy contributions from individual conformational regions are also calculated, and their relationship with the overall free energy is derived leading to a set of multiconformational free energy formulas. These relationships are of general applicability and can be used in free energy calculations for a more diverse set of compounds.},

Most practitioners seem to agree that {QSAR} has not fulfilled the expectations set for its ability to predict biological activity. Among the possible reasons that have been proposed recently for this disappointment are chance correlation, rough response surfaces, incorrect functional forms, and overtraining. Undoubtedly, each of these plays an important role in the lack of predictivity seen in most {QSAR} models. Likely to be just as important is the role of the fallacy cum hoc ergo propter hoc in the poor prediction seen with many {QSAR} models. By embracing fallacy along with an over reliance on statistical inference, it may well be that the manner in which {QSAR} is practiced is more responsible for its lack of success than any other innate cause.},

Chem. 1996, 100, 8587). Thermodynamic perturbation calculations with explicit solvent were used to determine the absolute solvation free energies. Two separate sets of chloroform simulations were performed differing only in the choice of atomic charges for chloroform and the bases. In the first simulations, labeled as charge set 1 {(CS1),} {RESP} was used with the {RHF/6-31G(3dt,2p)} basis set to determine the chloroform charges and the {RHF/6-31G(*)} basis set to determine the charges for the nucleic acid bases. For the second simulations, labeled as charge set 2 {(CS2),} the {CS1} chloroform charges were scaled down to reproduce the experimental dipole moment in solution, and the {CS1} bases charges were reduced by 10\%. The reduction of the atomic charges in the second model was done to account for the less polarizing environment of chloroform (as compared to water) and yielded a significant improvement in the calculated results. The partition coefficients calculated from {CS1} yielded an average absolute error of 1.5 log units compared to experiment, where in contrast, {CS2} shows good agreement, with an average absolute error of only 0.5 log units.},

Identification of the most efficient search methods is essential if we are to be able to apply such methods broadly and with confidence. In addition, efficient search methods provide a rigorous test of existing energy functions, which are generally knowledge-based and contain different terms added together with arbitrary weights. Here, we test different search methods with one of the most accurate and predictive energy functions, namely Rosetta the knowledge-based force-field from Baker's group {[Simons} K, Kooperberg C, Huang E, Baker D (1997) 268:209–225]. We use an implementation of a generalized ensemble search method to scale relevant parts of the energy function. This method, known as Hamiltonian Replica Exchange Monte Carlo, outperforms the original Monte Carlo Simulated Annealing used in the Rosetta package in terms of sampling low-energy states. It also outperforms another widely used generalized ensemble search method known as Temperature Replica Exchange Monte Carlo. Our results reveal clear deficiencies in the low-resolution Rosetta energy function in that the lowest energy structures are not necessarily the most native-like. By using a set of nonnative low-energy structures found by our extensive sampling, we discovered that the long-range and short-range backbone hydrogen-bonding energy terms of the Rosetta energy discriminate between the nonnative and native-like structures significantly better than the low-resolution score used in Rosetta.},

First, simple molecular descriptors for physicochemical properties: octanol-water partition (log P), water solubility (log S), dipole moment, Ionisation Potential {(IP)} and Electron Affinity {(EA)} were compared to their experimentally determined counterparts. For all of the descriptors, except {EA,} a relatively good linear correlation was obtained. Experimentally derived {EA} values are relatively scarce and often quite inconsistent, which made it difficult to construct a reliable test collection. When compared to values calculated by the Density Functional Theory {(DFT)} method a reasonable correlation was observed but there is much room for improvement. A clear Gaussian distribution pattern was obtained when a collection of sim470 marketed orally bioavailable drug compounds was used to generate the physicochemical properties investigated. The idea was explored whether the prediction power of {ADME} modules could be tested in a qualitative way, based on broad assumptions, using different classes of marketed drug compounds. It was found that this approach gives one a good idea about which modules deserve further attention for evaluation. In this way it is concluded that cell permeation and the blood-brain barrier modules merit more evaluation work whereas work on the {HERG} K+ and {CNS} activity modules was discontinued.},

	abstract = {Abstract  Combinatorial synthesis and large scale screening methods are being used increasingly in drug discovery, particularly for
finding novel lead compounds. Although these “random” methods sample larger areas of chemical space than traditional synthetic
approaches, only a relatively small percentage of all possible compounds are practically accessible. It is therefore helpful
to select regions of chemical space that have greater likelihood of yielding useful leads. When three-dimensional structural
data are available for the target molecule this can be achieved by applying structure-based computational design methods to
focus the combinatorial library. This is advantageous over the standard usage of computational methods to design a small number
of specific novel ligands, because here computation is employed as part of the combinatorial design process and so is required
only to determine a propensity for binding of certain chemical moieties in regions of the target molecule. This paper describes
the application of the Multiple Copy Simultaneous Search {(MCSS)} method, an active site mapping and de novo structure-based
design tool, to design a focused combinatorial library for the class {II} {MHC} protein {HLA-DR4.} Methods for the synthesizing
and screening the computationally designed library are presented; evidence is provided to show that binding was achieved.
Although the structure of the protein-ligand complex could not be determined, experimental results including cross-exclusion
of a known {HLA-DR4} peptide ligand {(HA)} by a compound from the library. Computational model building suggest that at least
one of the ligands designed and identified by the methods described binds in a mode similar to that of native peptides.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Synthetic receptors have a wide range of potential applications, but it has been difficult to design low molecular weight receptors that bind ligands with high, "proteinlike" affinities. This study uses novel computational methods to understand why it is hard to design a high-affinity receptor and to explore the limits of affinity, with the bioactive peptide {RGD} as a model ligand. The M2 modeling method is found to yield excellent agreement with experiment for a known {RGD} receptor and then is used to analyze a series of receptors generated in silico with a de novo design algorithm. Forces driving binding are found to be systematically opposed by proportionate repulsions due to desolvation and entropy. In particular, strong correlations are found between Coulombic attractions and the electrostatic desolvation penalty and between the mean energy change on binding and the cost in configurational entropy. These correlations help explain why it is hard to achieve high affinity. The change in surface area upon binding is found to correlate poorly with affinity within this series. Measures of receptor efficiency are formulated that summarize how effectively a receptor uses surface area, total energy, and Coulombic energy to achieve affinity. Analysis of the computed efficiencies suggests that a low molecular weight receptor can achieve proteinlike affinity. It is also found that macrocyclization of a receptor can, unexpectedly, increase the entropy cost of binding because the macrocyclic structure further restricts ligand motion.},

	abstract = {Binding free energies were calculated for the inhibitors lopinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir, amprenavir, and nelfinavir bound to {HIV-1} protease. An {MMPB/SA-type} analysis was applied to conformational samples from 3 ns explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations of the enzyme-inhibitor complexes. Binding affinities and the sampled conformations of the inhibitor and enzyme were compared between different {HIV-1} protease protonation states to find the most likely protonation state of the enzyme in the complex with each of the inhibitors. The resulting set of protonation states leads to good agreement between calculated and experimental binding affinities. Results from the {MMPB/SA} analysis are compared with an explicit/implicit hybrid scheme and with {MMGB/SA} methods. It is found that the inclusion of explicit water molecules may offer a slight advantage in reproducing absolute binding free energies while the use of the Generalized Born approximation significantly affects the accuracy of the calculated binding affinities. {\textbackslash}copyright 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently--those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard {Lennard-Jones} benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the {nCUBE} 2, Intel {iPSC/860} and Paragon, and Cray {T3D.} Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray {Y-MP} and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90\% and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray {C9O} processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},

This method uses a stack of grid software, which we call {STIMD,} that allows the scientist to easily distribute the necessary simulations around a computational grid thereby accelerating the process. We use this method to study how a series of phosphopeptides binds to the Src {SH2} domain. The binding of phosphopeptides to the Src {SH2} domain is described by the "two-pronged plug two-holed socket" model, and we investigate this model by reducing the length of the aliphatic side chain that engages the second of the two sockets through two successive alchemical mutations. Seven different values of G have been calculated, and we report good agreement with experiment. We then propose an extension to this model using the insights gained from a free energy component analysis.},

The inhibitors investigated were initially proposed as part of the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Free Energy Evaluation {(CATFEE)} project for which no experimental results nor any assessment of the predictions submitted by various groups have ever been published. The inhibitors studied represent a severe challenge for explicit free energy calculations. The mutations from one compound to another involve up to 19 atoms, the creation and annihilation of net charge and several alternate binding modes. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain highly converged results ( /- 5-10 {kJ/mol)} even for such complex multi-atom mutations by simulating on a nanosecond time scale. This is achieved by using soft-core potentials to facilitate the creation and deletion of atoms and by a careful choice of mutation pathway. The results show that given modest computational resources, explicit free energy calculations can be successfully applied to realistic problems in drug design.},

	abstract = {The immune system responds to the introduction of foreign antigens by rapidly evolving antibodies with increasing affinity for the antigen (i.e., maturation). To investigate the factors that control this process at the molecular level, we have assessed the changes in flexibility that accompany ligand binding at four stages of maturation in the 4-4-20 antibody. Our studies, based on molecular dynamics, indicate that increased affinity for the target ligand is associated with a decreased entropic cost to binding. The entropy of binding is unfavorable, opposing favorable enthalpic contributions that arise during complex formation. Computed binding free energies for the various antibodyligand complexes qualitatively reproduce the trends observed in the experimentally derived values, although the absolute magnitude of free-energy differences is overestimated. Our results support the existence of a correlation between high-affinity interactions and decreased protein flexibility in this series of antibody molecules. This observation is likely to be a general feature of molecular association processes and key to the molecular evolution of antibody responses. 10.1073/pnas.0610064104},

This change of van der Waals parameters does not change hydrophilic solvation, since calculations using either water model lead to the same relative solvation free energy between ethane and methanol. The solvation free-energy differences between methane and ethane and between ethane and propane have also been calculated with both models, and results found with the two water models are similar.

Unlike traditional free energy perturbation and thermodynamic integration methods, lambda-dynamics treats the conventional ldquolambdardquo as a dynamic variable in free energy simulations and simultaneously evaluates thermodynamic properties for multiple states in a single simulation. In the present article, we provide an overview of the theory of lambda-dynamics, including the use of biasing and restraining potentials to facilitate conformational sampling. We review how lambda-dynamics has been used to rapidly and reliably compute relative hydration free energies and binding affinities for series of ligands, to accurately identify crystallographically observed binding modes starting from incorrect orientations, and to model the effects of mutations upon protein stability. Finally, we suggest how lambda-dynamics may be extended to facilitate modeling efforts in structure-based drug design. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem 2009},

Interestingly and importantly a theoretical study shows that moderate {pH} and conductivity differences as well as adsorption and all of the above interactions when they are characterized by a fast on/off kinetics do not increase the zone broadening (or only slightly), because the sharpening of one boundary of the zone is about the same as the broadening of the other boundary. In addition the peak symmetry caused by a conductivity difference is in most experiments counteracted by a {pH} difference. The experimentally determined plate numbers in the absence of electroosmosis exceeded one million per meter in some experiments {(Part} {II).} These plate numbers are among the highest reported {[Z.} Zhao, A. Malik, {M.L.} Lee, Anal. Chem. 65 (1993) 2747; M. Gilges, K. Kleemiss, G. Schomburg, Anal. Chem. 66 (1994) 2038; H. Wan, M. Ohman, {L.G.} Blomberg, J. Chromatogr. A 924 (2001) 59] (plate numbers determined in the presence of electroosmosis may be higher, although the width of the zone in the capillary may be larger) [p. 680 in S. Hjerten, Electrophoresis 11 (1990) 665]). Capillary free zone electrophoresis is perhaps the only separation method, which, under optimum conditions, gives a plate number not far from the theoretical limit. A prerequisite for this high performance is that the polyacrylamide-coated capillary is washed with 2 M {HCl} between the runs and stored in water over night {(Part} {II).} The difference between the experimentally determined total variance and the sum of the calculated variances originating from the width of the starting zone, longitudinal diffusion, Joule heating, sedimentation in the vertical section of the capillary, curvature of the capillary (i.e., the sum of all other variances) was in our most successful experiments about 28\% of the variance of diffusion. The zone broadening, 2sigma, caused by diffusion was estimated at 0.77 mm. The total zone width (2sigma) calculated from the experimentally determined plate number was as small as 1 mm when the migration distance was 40 cm. Accordingly, the only efficient way to reduce drastically the total zone width is to decrease the analysis time and, thereby, the diffusional broadening. An important finding was that the variance originating from the loops of the capillary is not always negligible in high-performance runs. Therefore, one should employ straight capillaries and avoid {CE} apparatus with cartridges that require a strong curvature of the capillary, common in most commercial instruments. Mathematical formulas have been derived for the sedimentation of the solute zone, the enrichment factor, and the migration time in experiments where the solute is dissolved in a dilute running buffer. This zone sharpening method gave very narrow starting zones (0.04-0.4 mm). However, upon high dilution of the buffer the enrichment becomes so strong that part of the sample zone probably sediments out of the capillary; the almost inevitable change in {pH} may decrease the mobility of the proteins and, thus, cause the enrichment factor to become still lower than expected. Diffusion of the protein in the very narrow starting zone (located close to the tip of the capillary) and sometimes the thermal expansion of the buffer in the capillary contributes to additional loss of protein in the enrichment step. In some buffers, the interaction between the protein and the buffer constituents is so slow that the peaks become broad. Therefore, different types of buffers should be tested when high resolution is required. The relation sigma(2) (the variance of the interaction between a protein and the buffer constituents) = constant x u (the mobility) seems to be valid for all proteins in the applied sample, at least when they have similar molecular masses. To facilitate the understanding of the progress of a free zone electrophoresis experiment, we have discussed in simple terms how the concentrations of the background electrolytes become rearranged during a run and why the difference between the mobilities of the proteins and the mobilities of the background electrolyte determines whether a peak exhibits fronting or tailing. A theoretical analysis of zone broadening in capillary zone electrophoresis, chromatography, and electrochromatography indicates that electrochromatography in homogeneous gels might be the only chromatographic technique which can compete in performance with free electrophoresis. Using an equation, valid not only for electrophoresis, but also for chromatography and centrifugation, the mobility of a concentration boundary has been calculated for the first time and was, as expected, low. Equations based on the Kohlrausch regulating function do not permit such calculations. Another regulating function (the H function) and some of its characteristics are briefly discussed. The theoretical discussions in this paper and the experimental studies in Part {II} show that high-performance electrophoresis deserves its prefix when the runs are designed to give minimum zone broadening. Some guidelines are given to facilitate this optimization. The plate numbers are so high that the resolution cannot be increased by more than 30\% even if they approach the theoretically maximum values. {(C)} 2004 Published by Elsevier {B.V.}},

A single molecular dynamics simulation of a judiciously chosen reference state (using two sets of soft-core interactions) is sufficient to determine conformational distributions of chemically similar compounds and the free energy differences between them. The {ES-OS} method is applied to a set of five biologically relevant 8-substituted {GTP} analogs having high energy barriers between the anti and the syn conformations of the base with respect to the ribose part. The reliability of {ES-OS} is verified by comparing the results to Hamiltonian replica exchange simulations of {GTP} and {8-Br-GTP} and the experimentally determined {3J(C4,H1′)} coupling constant for {GMP} in water. Additional simulations in vacuum and octanol allow us to calculate differences in the solvation free energies and in lipophilicities (log P). Free energy contributions from individual conformational regions are also calculated, and their relationship with the overall free energy is derived leading to a set of multiconformational free energy formulas. These relationships are of general applicability and can be used in free energy calculations for a more diverse set of compounds.},

In this study, computational methods are combined with experimental techniques. Molecular dynamics simulations, resonance Raman and {UV-VIS} spectroscopy, as well as coupling efficiency and substrate-binding experiments, have been performed. The computational findings, supported by the experimental results, enable structural rationalizations of the mutants. The substrates used in this study are known to be metabolized by human cytochrome P450 {2D6.} Interestingly, the major metabolites formed by the P450 {BM3} mutants differ from those formed by human cytochrome P450 {2D6.} The computational findings, supported by resonance Raman data, suggest a conformational change of one of the heme propionate groups. The modeling results furthermore suggest that this conformational change allows for an interaction between the negatively charged carboxylate of the heme substituent and the positively charged nitrogen of the substrates. This allows for an orientation of the substrates favorable for formation of the major metabolite by P450 {BM3.} Proteins 2008. {\textbackslash}copyright 2007 {Wiley-Liss,} Inc.},

Permeability properties are obtained through a refined version of the z-constraint algorithm. By constraining each permeant at selected depths inside the bilayer, we have sampled free energy differences and diffusion coefficients across the membrane. These data have been combined, according to the inhomogeneous solubility−diffusion model, to yield the permeability coefficients. The results are generally consistent with previous atomic-level calculations and available experimental data. Computationally, our multiscale approach proves 2 orders of magnitude faster than traditional atomic-level methods.},

Comparisons with published and new canonical {MP2} calculations on the alanine dipeptide are made. Results for ten gas-phase tetrapeptide conformations and a beta-sheet dipeptide dimer are compared with 20 different molecular mechanics force field parametrizations, providing the first assessment of the reliability of these models for systems larger than a dipeptide. Comparisons are made with the {LMP2/cc-pVTZ(-f)} results, which are taken as a benchmark for the tetrapeptides. Statistical summaries with regard to energetics and structure are produced for each farce field, and a discussion of qualitative successes and failures is provided. The results display both the successes and limitations of the force fields studied and can be used as benchmark data in the development of new and improved force fields. In particular, comparisons of hydrogen-bonding energetics as a function of geometry suggest that future force fields will need to employ a representation for electrostatics that goes beyond the use of atom-centered partial charges.},

Reasonably accurate entropy differences are obtained through thermodynamic integration in which many copies of a solute are desolvated. When only one solute molecule is involved, only two methods seem to yield useful results, the calculation of solute-solvent entropy through thermodynamic integration, and the calculation of solvation entropy through the temperature derivative of the corresponding free-energy difference. One-step perturbation methods seem unsuitable to obtain entropy estimates. (41 refs.)},

Using a very smoothed, soft interaction function and increased hydrogen masses, a time step of 14 fs can be reached.

	abstract = {We investigated the convergence behavior of potential of mean force {(PMF)} calculations using free energy perturbation {(FEP),} thermodynamic integration {(TI),} and ”slow growth” {(SG)} techniques. The critical comparison of these alternative approaches is illustrated by the study of three different systems: two tagged argon atoms in a periodic box of argon, two methane molecules, and two benzene molecules maintained in a {”T-shaped”} conformation, both dimers embedded in a periodic box of water. The complete {PMF} simulations were carried out considering several protocols, in which the number of intermediate ”lambda” states, together with the amount of sampling per individual state, were varied. In most cases, as much as 1 ns of molecular dynamics {(MD)} sampling, was used to derive each free energy profile. For the different systems examined, we find that {FEP} and {TI} unquestionably constitute robust computational methods leading to results of comparable accuracy. We also show that proper convergence of the free energy calculations, and further quantitative interpretation of the {PMFs,} requires total simulation times much higher than has been hitherto estimated. In some circumstances, the free energy profiles derived from {FEP} calculations tend to be slightly poorer than those obtained with {TI,} as a probable consequence of the greater sensitivity of {FEP} to the window spacing delta lambda. Ln the context of {TI,} and to a lesser extent {FEP,} simulations, it appears preferable to employ a limited number of ”lambda” points of the integrand involving extensive sampling, rather than numerous points with fewer samplings. Finally, we note that, at least in the case of nonpolar interactions, {PMFs} of reasonable quality can be generated using {SG,} and at a substantially lower cost than with either {FEP} or {TI.} {(C)} 1996 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

We derive in a compact way a general formulation for evaluating these derivatives as the average of a mean force acting on the order parameters, which involves first derivatives with respect to both Cartesian coordinates and time. This is in contrast with the previously derived formulas, which require first and second derivatives of the order parameter with respect to Cartesian coordinates. As illustrated in a concrete example, the main advantage of this new formulation is the simplicity of its use, especially for complicated order parameters. It is also straightforward to implement in a molecular dynamics code, as can be seen from the pseudocode given at the end. We further discuss how the approach based on time derivatives can be combined with the adaptive biasing force method, an enhanced sampling technique that rapidly yields uniform sampling of the order parameters, and by doing so greatly improves the efficiency of free energy calculations. Using the backbone dihedral angles Phi and Psi in {N-acetylalanyl-N[prime]-methylamide} as a numerical example, we present a technique to reconstruct the free energy from its derivatives, a calculation that presents some difficulties in the vector case because of the statistical errors affecting the derivatives.},

They share the common feature of adding external perturbations along a conformational progress variable to guide the transition in a predefined direction in conformational space, yet differ in how these perturbations are applied. In the present paper, we report a comparison of these three methods on generating transition paths for two different processes: the unfolding of the B domain of protein A and a conformational transition of the catalytic domain of a Src kinase Lyn. Transition pathways were calculated with different simulation parameters including the choice of progress variable and the simulation length or biasing force constant. A comparison of the generated paths based on structural similarity finds that the three perturbation {MD} methods generate similar transition paths for a given progress variable in most cases. On the other hand, the path depends more strongly on the choice of progress variable used to move the system between the initial and final states. Potentials of mean force {(PMF)} were calculated starting from unfolding trajectories to estimate the relative probabilities of the paths. A lower {PMF} was found for the lowest biasing force constant with {BMD.}},

	abstract = {The {AM1-BCC} method quickly and efficiently generates high-quality atomic charges for use in condensed-phase simulations. The underlying features of the electron distribution including formal charge and delocalization are first captured by {AM1} atomic charges for the individual molecule. Bond charge corrections {(BCCs),} which have been parameterized against the {HF/6-31G*} electrostatic potential {(ESP)} of a training set of compounds containing relevant functional groups, are then added using a formalism identical to the consensus {BCI} (bond charge increment) approach. As a proof of the concept, we fit {BCCs} simultaneously to 45 compounds including O-, N-, and S-containing functionalities, aromatics, and heteroaromatics, using only 41 {BCC} parameters. {AM1-BCC} yields charge sets of comparable quality to {HF/6-31G*} {ESP-derived} charges in a fraction of the time while reducing instabilities in the atomic charges compared to direct {ESP-fit} methods. We then apply the {BCC} parameters to a small test set consisting of aspirin, d-glucose, and eryodictyol; the {AM1-BCC} model again provides atomic charges of quality comparable with {HF/6-31G*} {RESP} charges, as judged by an increase of only 0.01 to 0.02 atomic units in the root-mean-square {(RMS)} error in {ESP.} Based on these encouraging results, we intend to parameterize the {AM1-BCC} model to provide a consistent charge model for any organic or biological molecule.},

The insights gained from designing these artificial molecular sieves and filters, along with the promising results gathered from their first applications, serve to illustrate the impact that they can have on improving future separation of complex biological samples.

	abstract = {A new derivation of the {GLYCAM06} force field, which removes its previous specificity for carbohydrates, and its dependency on the {AMBER} force field and parameters, is presented. All pertinent force field terms have been explicitly specified and so no default or generic parameters are employed. The new {GLYCAM} is no longer limited to any particular class of biomolecules, but is extendible to all molecular classes in the spirit of a small-molecule force field. The torsion terms in the present work were all derived from quantum mechanical data from a collection of minimal molecular fragments and related small molecules. For carbohydrates, there is now a single parameter set applicable to both alpha- and beta-anomers and to all monosaccharide ring sizes and conformations. We demonstrate that deriving dihedral parameters by fitting to {QM} data for internal rotational energy curves for representative small molecules generally leads to correct rotamer populations in molecular dynamics simulations, and that this approach removes the need for phase corrections in the dihedral terms. However, we note that there are cases where this approach is inadequate. Reported here are the basic components of the new force field as well as an illustration of its extension to carbohydrates. In addition to reproducing the gas-phase properties of an array of small test molecules, condensed-phase simulations employing {GLYCAM06} are shown to reproduce rotamer populations for key small molecules and representative biopolymer building blocks in explicit water, as well as crystalline lattice properties, such as unit cell dimensions, and vibrational frequencies. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {We consider ways to quantify the overlap of the parts of phase space important to two systems, labeled A and B. Of interest is how much of the A-important phase space lies in that important to B, and how much of B lies in A. Two measures are proposed. The first considers four total-energy distributions, formed from all combinations made by tabulating either the A-system or the B-system energy when sampling either the A or B system. Measures for A in B and B in A are given by two overlap integrals defined on pairs of these distributions. The second measure is based on information theory, and defines two relative entropies which are conveniently expressed in terms of the dissipated work for free-energy perturbation {(FEP)} calculations in the {A-{\textgreater}B} and {B-{\textgreater}A} directions, respectively. Phase-space overlap is an important consideration in the performance of free-energy calculations. To demonstrate this connection, we examine bias in {FEP} calculations applied to a system of independent particles in a harmonic potential. Systems are selected to represent a range of overlap situations, including extreme subset, subset, partial overlap, and nonoverlap. The magnitude and symmetry of the bias {(A-{\textgreater}B} vs. {B-{\textgreater}A)} are shown to correlate well with the overlap, and consequently with the overlap measures. The relative entropies are used to scale the amount of sampling to obtain a universal bias curve. This result leads to develop a simple heuristic that can be applied to determine whether a work-based free-energy measurement is free of bias. The heuristic is based in part on the measured free energy, but we argue that it is fail-safe inasmuch as any bias in the measurement will not promote a false indication of accuracy.},

	abstract = {A major component of the cellular antiviral system is the latent protein kinase {PKR,} which is activated by binding to either double-stranded {RNA} {(dsRNA)} or the cellular {PACT} protein. Activated {PKR} phosphorylates the translation initiation factor {eIF2,} thereby inhibiting viral and cellular protein synthesis and virus replication. To evade the antiviral effects of {PKR,} many viruses, including influenza A virus, have evolved multiple mechanisms. For influenza A virus, the non-structural {(NS1A)} protein plays a major role in blocking activation of {PKR} during virus infection. The mechanism by which the {NS1A} protein inhibits {PKR} activation in infected cells has not been established. In the present study, we first carried out a series of in vitro experiments to determine whether the {NS1A} protein could utilize a common mechanism to inhibit {PKR} activation by both {PACT} and {dsRNA,} despite their different modes of activation. We demonstrated that the direct binding of the {NS1A} protein to the N-terminal 230 amino acid region of {PKR} can serve as such a common mechanism and that this binding does not require the {RNA-binding} activity of the {NS1A} protein. The lack of requirement for {NS1A} {RNA-binding} activity for the inhibition of {PKR} activation in vivo was established by two approaches. First, we showed that an {NS1A} protein lacking {RNA-binding} activity, like the wild-type (wt) protein, blocked {PKR} activation by {PACT} in vivo, as well as the downstream effects of {PKR} activation in cells, namely, {eIF2} phosphorylation and apoptosis. In addition, we demonstrated that {PKR} activation is inhibited in cells infected with a recombinant influenza A virus expressing {NS1A} mutant protein that cannot bind {RNA,} as is the case in cells infected with wild-type influenza A virus.},

Here, a method is presented that estimates the contribution of the protonation equilibria of a ligand in solution to the measured or calculated binding affinity. The method yields a correction to binding constants that are based on the total concentration of inhibitor (the sum of all ionized forms of the inhibitor in solution) to account for the complexed form of the inhibitor only. The method is applied to the calculation of the difference in binding affinity of two inhibitors, 2-phosphoglycolate {(PGA)} and its phoshonate analog 3-phosphonopropionate {(3PP),} for the glycolytic enzyme triosephosphate isomerase. Both inhibitors have three titrating sites and exist in solution as a mixture of different forms. In this case the form that actually binds to the enzyme is present at relative low concentrations. The contributions of the alternative forms to the difference in binding energies is estimated by means of molecular dynamics simulations and corrections. The inhibitors undergo a {pKa} shift upon binding that is estimated by ab initio calculations. An interesting finding is that the affinity difference of the two inhibitors is not due to different interactions in the active site of the enzyme, but rather due to the difference in the solvation properties of the inhibitors.

	abstract = {Free energy calculations are increasingly being used to estimate absolute and relative binding free energies of ligands to proteins. However, computed free energies often appear to depend on the initial protein conformation, indicating incomplete sampling. This is especially true when proteins can change conformation on ligand binding, as free energies associated with these conformational changes are either ignored or assumed to be included by virtue of the sampling performed in the calculation. Here, we show that, in a model protein system (a designed binding site in T4 lysozyme), conformational changes can make a difference of several kcal/mol in computed binding free energies and that they are neglected in computed binding free energies if the system remains kinetically trapped in a particular metastable state on simulation timescales. We introduce a general "confine-and-release" framework for free energy calculations that accounts for these free energies of conformational change. We illustrate its use in this model system by demonstrating that an umbrella sampling protocol can obtain converged binding free energies that are independent of the starting protein structure and include these conformational change free energies.},

	doi = {10.1007/s10822-010-9329-5},
	abstract = {Abstract  It appears so simple at first glance, “tautomers are isomers of organic compounds that readily interconvert, usually by the
migration of hydrogen from one atom to another”. If a chemist can describe the problem so succinctly, one might question why
the complication of tautomerism remains a considerable challenge to cheminformatics and computer-assisted drug design. With
a half-century of experience with representing molecules in computers, and almost limitless modern computational power, the
problem should have been solved by now. The unfortunate answer is that the frustration and inconvenience of a database search
failing to find matches due to differences in the tautomeric forms of the query and registered compounds is but the tip of
an iceberg. Prototropic tautomerism, the movement of hydrogens around a molecule, is but just one aspect of an interconnected
web of complications. These include mesomerism, aromaticity, protonation state, stereochemistry, conformation, polymerization,
photostability, hydrolysis, metabolism and {EOCWR} (explodes on contact with reality). The common theme is that valence theory,
which underlies all modern chemical informatics systems, is an approximate theoretical model for representing molecules mathematically,
and, as with all models, it has limitations and domains of applicability. In the physical environments that chemists care
about, small organic molecules are often dynamic, existing in multiple equivalent or interconvertible forms. A single connection
table can at best represent a snapshot or sample from these populations. Although partial algorithmic solutions exist for
handling the most common cases of tautomerism, this perspective hopes to argue that the underlying problems perhaps make tautomerism
more complex than it might first appear.},

We apply and verify our method in a fluid composed of Ngreater than or equal to2 hard disks in elastic collisions.

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.0502983102},
	abstract = {In type 2 diabetes, the liver produces excessive amounts of glucose through the gluconeogenesis {(GNG)} pathway and consequently is partly responsible for the elevated glucose levels characteristic of the disease. In an effort to find safe and efficacious {GNG} inhibitors, we targeted the {AMP} binding site of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase {(FBPase).} The hydrophilic nature of {AMP} binding sites and their widespread use for allosteric regulation of enzymes in metabolic pathways has historically made discovery of {AMP} mimetics suitable for drug development difficult. By using a structure-based drug design strategy, we discovered a series of compounds that mimic {AMP} but bear little structural resemblance. The lead compound, {MB05032,} exhibited high potency and specificity for human {FBPase.} Oral delivery of {MB05032} was achieved by using the bisamidate prodrug {MB06322} {(CS-917),} which is converted to {MB05032} in two steps through the action of an esterase and a phosphoramidase. {MB06322} inhibited glucose production from a variety of {GNG} substrates in rat hepatocytes and from bicarbonate in male Zucker diabetic fatty rats. Analysis of liver {GNG} pathway intermediates confirmed {FBPase} as the site of action. Oral administration of {MB06322} to Zucker diabetic fatty rats led to a dose-dependent decrease in plasma glucose levels independent of insulin levels and nutritional status. Glucose lowering occurred without signs of hypoglycemia or significant elevations in plasma lactate or triglyceride levels. The findings suggest that potent and specific {FBPase} inhibitors represent a drug class with potential to treat type 2 diabetes through inhibition of {GNG.} 10.1073/pnas.0502983102},

It is shown that both the one-step {(OS)} perturbation method and the linear interaction energy {(LIE)} method have complementing strengths and weaknesses and can be optimally combined in a new manner. The {OS} method has a sound theoretical basis to address the free energy of cavity formation, whereas the {LIE} approach is more versatile and efficient to calculate the free energy of adding charges to such cavities. The off-term, which is neglected in the original {LIE} equation, can be calculated without additional costs from the {OS,} offering a powerful synergy between the two methods. The {LIE/OS} approach presented here combines the best of two worlds and for the model systems studied here, is more accurate than and as efficient as the original methods. It has a sound theoretical background and no longer requires any empirical parameters. The method appears very well suited for application in lead-optimization programmes in drug research, where the structure and dynamics of a series of molecules is of interest, together with an accurate calculation of the binding free energy. � 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The amphiphilic nature of the 1-octanol molecules allows the octanol phase to mimic the complexities of many different environments ranging from biomembranes to soil. However, the structural details of the octanol phase and whether its structure is altered upon water saturation are not yet fully understood. Configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in the Gibbs ensemble demonstrate that a diverse spectrum of hydrogen-bonded aggregates exists in dry and wet 1-octanol, and that water saturation substantially alters the 1-octanol environment from predominantly linear aggregates in dry octanol to larger cylindrical micelles with water cores in wet octanol. These simulation results are able to reconcile the conflicting views (chainlike or water-centered aggregates vs spherical micelles) of the 1-octanol structure inferred from thermodynamic arguments, spectroscopic measurements, and diffraction experiments. Calculated partition constants quantify the influence of water saturation on the solubility characteristics of the dry and wet octanol phases.},

The computed changes in configurational entropy are comparable in magnitude to the changes in mean potential plus solvation energy, and they result primarily from changes in the average width of the energy wells upon binding. A strong correlation is observed between the changes in configurational energy and configurational entropy upon binding, resulting in near-linear compensation analogous to classical entropy-enthalpy compensation.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen bonds play an important role in stabilizing (meta-)stable states in protein folding. Hence, they can potentially be used as a way to bias these states in molecular simulation methods. Previously, Wolf et al. showed that applying repulsive and attractive hydrogen bond biasing potentials in an alternating way significantly accelerates the folding process {(Wolf,} M. G.; de Leeuw, S. W. Biophys. J. 2008, 94, 3742). As the biasing potentials are only active during a fixed time interval, this alternating scheme does not represent a thermodynamic equilibrium. In this work, we present a Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics {(REMD)} scheme that aims to shuffle and reorder hydrogen bonds in the protein backbone. We therefore apply adapted hydrogen bond potentials in a Hamiltonian {REMD} scheme, which we call hydrogen bond switching {(HS).} To compare the performance of the {HS} to a standard {REMD} method, we performed {HS} and temperature {REMD} simulations of a β-heptapeptide in methanol. Both methods sample the conformational space to a similar extent. As the {HS} simulation required only five replicas, while the {REMD} simulation required 20 replicas, the {HS} method is significantly more efficient. We tested the {HS} method also on a larger system, 16-residue polyalanine in water. Both of the simulations starting from a completely unfolded and a folded conformation resulted in an ensemble with, apart from the starting structure, similar conformational minima. We can conclude that the {HS} method provides an efficient way to sample the conformational space of a protein, without requiring knowledge of the folded states beforehand. In addition, these simulations revealed that convergence was hampered by replicas having a preference for specific biasing potentials. As this sorting effect is inherent to any Hamiltonian {REMD} method, finding a solution will result in an additional increase in the efficiency of Hamiltonian {REMD} methods in general.},

The initial configurations of the system were equilibrated with the-hexane molecules in the all trans configuration. The major findings are (1) the Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics results for thermodynamic properties and conformer populations are in accord, (2) the conformer populations reach equilibrium in ca. 10(7) Monte Carlo configurations or 100 ps of molecular dynamics, and (3) the molecular dynamics calculations require 1.6-3.8 times more computer time to achieve the same level of convergence as the Monte Carlo simulations.

The availability of large protein databases generated from sequences of hundreds of bacterial genomes enables various statistical approaches to this problem. In this context covariance-based methods have been used to identify correlation between amino acid positions in interacting proteins. However, these methods have an important shortcoming, in that they cannot distinguish between directly and indirectly correlated residues. We developed a method that combines covariance analysis with global inference analysis, adopted from use in statistical physics. Applied to a set of {\textgreater}2,500 representatives of the bacterial two-component signal transduction system, the combination of covariance with global inference successfully and robustly identified residue pairs that are proximal in space without resorting to ad hoc tuning parameters, both for heterointeractions between sensor kinase {(SK)} and response regulator {(RR)} proteins and for homointeractions between {RR} proteins. The spectacular success of this approach illustrates the effectiveness of the global inference approach in identifying direct interaction based on sequence information alone. We expect this method to be applicable soon to interaction surfaces between proteins present in only 1 copy per genome as the number of sequenced genomes continues to expand. Use of this method could significantly increase the potential targets for therapeutic intervention, shed light on the mechanism of protein–protein interaction, and establish the foundation for the accurate prediction of interacting protein partners.},

	abstract = {Brownian dynamics simulations are carried out to compare the predictions of a bead-spring chain model with the bead-rod model and a model with stiff {FENE-Fraenkel} springs. The successive fine graining {(SFG)} scheme is used to extrapolate the results of bead-spring chain simulations to the limit where the number of springs {(N-s)} approaches the number of rods (equal to the number of Kuhn steps, N-k) in a bead-rod model. It is found that in the absence of excluded volume {(EV)} and hydrodynamic interactions {(HI),} the analytical results for linear viscoelastic properties obtained using the bead-spring model with the {SFG} scheme are in complete agreement with the infinitely stiff Fraenkel spring results. The numerical computations of linear viscoelastic properties in the presence of {HI} are found to be in good agreement with the results of the bead-rod model. In shear flow, the {SFG} results show excellent agreement with bead-rod results for a range of shear rates both in the absence and presence of {HI} and {EV.} In the limit N-s -{\textgreater} N-k, the numerical and analytical results obtained using the {SFG} scheme are found to be independent of the choice of spring force law.

	abstract = {The construction and use of nonflat agarose surfaces in a simulation box, together with the employment of criteria for the immobilization of a set of dextran polymer chains on the nonflat agarose surfaces whose mathematical physics is compatible with that of the criteria used for the immobilization of the same set of dextran polymer chains on flat agarose surfaces, are shown to generate, through the use of molecular dynamics simulations whose simulation box has linear dimensions along the lateral directions that are the same when flat and nonflat agarose surfaces are used, dextran porous polymer structures whose pore sizes at the outermost surface and in the vicinity of the outermost surface of the porous medium can be controlled by an indirect manner through the variation of the parameters that characterize the nonflat surface. The use of a nonflat surface for the generation of desired large pores requires only a small or modest increase in the number of solvent molecules in the simulation box, while the use of a flat surface for the construction of the same desired large pores requires significant increases in the size of the linear dimensions of the flat surface. This increases so substantially the number of solvent molecules that the computational loads become intractable. The results in this work show that through the use of nonflat surfaces porous dextran polymer layers having pores of desired sizes can be effectively constructed, and this approach could be used for the design and construction of polymer-based porous adsorbent media that could effectively facilitate the transport and adsorption of an adsorbate biomolecule of interest that must be separated from a mixture of components. A useful definition about the properties that a porous polymer structure must have in order to become, for an adsorbate biomolecule of interest of known molecular size, a useful adsorbent medium, is presented and is used to (1) evaluate the porous polymer structures generated through the employment of different nonflat surface models and (2) determine and select the nonflat surface model from a set of nonflat surface models that is effective in producing promising porous structures. Then a procedure is presented by which a set of porous polymer media is generated through the use of the selected nonflat surface model, and the desired porous structure from this set is determined and could be considered to be used for the transport and immobilization of the selected affinity groups/ligands and the subsequent transport and adsorption of the desired to be separated adsorbate.},

We report X-ray crystal structures for {RT} complexed with three different pyridinone derivatives, R157208, R165481, and R221239, at 2.95, 2.9, and 2.43 A resolution, respectively. All three ligands exhibit nanomolar or subnanomolar inhibitory activity against wild-type {RT,} but varying activities against drug-resistant mutants. R165481 and R221239 differ from most {NNRTIs} in that binding does not involve significant contacts with Tyr181. These compounds strongly inhibit wild-type {HIV-1} {RT} and drug-resistant variants, including {Tyr181Cys} and {Lys103Asn} {RT.} These properties result in part from an iodine atom on the pyridinone ring of both inhibitors that interacts with the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Tyr188. An acrylonitrile substituent on R165481 substantially improves the activity of the compound against wild-type {RT} (and several mutants) and provides a way to generate novel inhibitors that could interact with conserved elements of {HIV-1} {RT} at the polymerase catalytic site. In R221239, there is a flexible linker to a furan ring that permits interactions with Val106, Phe227, and Pro236. These contacts appear to enhance the inhibitory activity of R221239 against the {HIV-1} strains that carry the {Val106Ala,} {Tyr188Leu,} and {Phe227Cys} mutations.},

	volume = {61},
	abstract = {{GP} catalyzes the phosphorylation of glycogen to {Glc-1-P.} Because of its fundamental role in the metabolism of glycogen, {GP} has been the target for a systematic structure-assisted design of inhibitory compounds, which could be of value in the therapeutic treatment of type 2 diabetes melli- tus. The most potent catalytic-site inhibitor of {GP} identified to date is spirohydantoin of glucopyr- anose (hydan). In this work, we employ {MD} free energy simulations to calculate the relative binding affinities for {GP} of hydan and two spirohydantoin analogues, methyl-hydan and n-hydan, in which a hydrogen atom is replaced by a methyl- or amino group, respectively. The results are compared with the experimental relative affinities of these ligands, estimated by kinetic measurements of the ligand inhibition constants. The calculated binding affin- ity for methyl-hydan (relative to hydan) is 3.75 {\textasciicircum}@ 1.4 kcal/mol, in excellent agreement with the experimental value (3.6 {\textasciicircum}@ 0.2 kcal/mol). For n-hydan, the calculated value is 1.0 {\textasciicircum}@ 1.1 kcal/mol, somewhat smaller than the experimental result (2.3 {\textasciicircum}@ 0.1 kcal/mol). A free energy decomposition analysis shows that hydan makes optimum interactions with protein residues and specific water molecules in the catalytic site. In the other two ligands, structural perturbations of the active site by the additional methyl- or amino group reduce the corresponding binding affinities. The computed binding free energies are sensitive to the preference of a specific water molecule for two well-defined positions in the catalytic site. The behavior of this water is analyzed in detail, and the free energy profile for the translocation of the water between the two positions is evaluated. The results provide insights into the role of water molecules in modulating ligand binding affinities. A comparison of the interactions between a set of ligands and their surrounding groups in X-ray structures is often used in the interpretation of binding free energy differences and in guiding the design of new ligands. For the systems in this work, such an approach fails to estimate the order ofrelative binding strengths, in contrast to the rigorous free energy treatment.},

	abstract = {By considering all possible mutations among four para-substituted phenols, p-chlorophenol, p-methylphenol, p-cyanophenol, and p-methoxyphenol, which bind as inclusion compounds in alpha-cyclodextrin, the convergence properties of thermodynamic integration free energy calculations using slow growth as compared to numerical quadrature are investigated and interpreted in terms of structural and dynamical properties of the molecular system. It is shown that a systematic increase in the calculated hysteresis can be expected with increasing simulation time in slow-growth calculations if the system is perturbed faster than the rate at which the various states that make up the equilibrium ensemble are sampled. Using numerical quadrature the effects of nonequilibrium can be largely separated from the effects of insufficient sampling. It is shown, however, that the apparent degree of convergence when using numerical quadrature does not necessarily reflect the accuracy of the calculation. The utility of formulating closed cycles in both the bound and unbound states as a means of determining the minimum error in a given calculation is demonstrated. The effects of the choice of pathway and of the choice of integration scheme on convergence within closed cycles are also discussed. Finally, the quality of the force field used and the relative importance of the force field as opposed to sampling considerations are assessed by comparing the estimated free energy differences to experimental data. It is shown that a meaningful appraisal of a specific force field cannot be made independent of sampling considerations. A modification to the {GROMOS} force field that improved the agreement between the calculated and experimental free energies for the mutation of p-chlorophenol to p-methylphenol is also proposed.},

High throughput screening {(HTS)} leads tend to have higher {MWT} and Log P and lower turbidimetric solubility than leads in the {pre-HTS} era. In the development setting, solubility calculations focus on exact value prediction and are difficult because of polymorphism.

	abstract = {A general methodology for calculating the equilibrium binding constant of a flexible ligand to a protein receptor is formulated on the basis of potentials of mean force. The overall process is decomposed into several stages that can be computed separately: the free ligand in the bulk is first restrained into the conformation it adopts in the bound state, position, and orientation by applying biasing potentials, then it is translated into the binding site, where it is released completely. The conformational restraining potential is based on the root-mean-square deviation of the peptide coordinates relative to its average conformation in the bound complex. Free energy contributions from each stage are calculated by means of free energy perturbation potential of mean force techniques by using appropriate order parameters. The present approach avoids the need to decouple the ligand from its surrounding (bulk solvent and receptor protein) as is traditionally performed in the double-decoupling scheme. It is believed that the present formulation will be particularly useful when the solvation free energy of the ligand is very large. As an application, the equilibrium binding constant of the phosphotyrosine peptide {pYEEI} to the Src homology 2 domain of human Lck has been calculated. The results are in good agreement with experimental values.},

We survey the backbone conformations observed in experimentally determined peptoid structures and provide a comparison with high-level quantum mechanics calculations of short peptoid oligomers. The dominant sources of structural variation derive from: side-chain dependent cis/trans isomerization of backbone amide bonds, side chain stereochemistry, and flexibility in the psi dihedral angle. We find good agreement between the clustering of experimentally determined peptoid torsion angles and local torsional minima predicted by theory for a disarcosine model. The calculations describe a well-defined conformational map featuring distinct energy minima. The general features of the peptoid backbone conformational landscape are consistent across a range of N-alkyl glycine side chains. Alteration of side chain types, however, creates subtle but potentially significant variations in local folding propensities. We identify a limited number of low energy local conformations, which may be preferentially favored by incorporation of particular monomer units. Greater variation in backbone dihedral angles are accessible in peptoids featuring trans amide bond geometries. These results confirm that computational approaches can play a valuable role in guiding the design of complex peptoid architectures and may lead to strategies for introducing constraints that select among a limited number of low energy local conformations.},

Two procedures for disappearing atoms during a single-topology {FEP} are investigated and dramatic differences in free energy convergence behavior are seen. Comparison of these two protocols suggests that the coupling of the removal of angular constraints with the disappearance of an atom may significantly slow free energy convergence. The series of ligands under investigation here cover a range of modifications at the 3-position of 4-([4-(cyclohexyl methoxy)benzyl]aminocarbonyl) phenyl phosphate. Unlike any other compound in this study, the 3-amide analog can form two hydrogen bonds within the region of the perturbation, one to a backbone amide hydrogen and one to a highly coordinated water molecule. Agreement with experimental trends in binding affinity is seen, although the computed relative free energy of binding of the amido compound is underestimated. These results are reconciled by examination of the hydration energies of model systems, which predict primary amides as too hydrophilic.},

Molecular dynamics {(MD),} principal component analysis {(PCA),} and binding free energy simulations are employed to explore the dynamics of {RT} and its interaction with the bound {NNRTI} nevirapine, for both wild-type and mutant {(V106A,} {Y181C,} {Y188C)} {RT.} These three mutations commonly arise in the presence of nevirapine and result in resistance to the drug. We show that a bound {NNRTI} hinders the motion of almost all {RT} amino acids. The mutations, located in the non-nucleoside {RT} inhibitor binding pocket, partially restore {RT} flexibility. The binding affinities calculated by molecular {mechanics/PoissonBoltzmann} surface accessibility {(MM-PBSA)} show that nevirapine interacts stronger with wild-type {RT} than with mutant {RT.} The mutations cause a loss of van der Waals interactions between the drug and the binding pocket. The results from this study suggest that a good inhibitor should efficiently enter and maximally occupy the binding pocket, thereby interacting effectively with the amino acids around the binding pocket.},

	abstract = {We present a new approach to calculating conformational equilibria in complex molecules, multiple-copy locally enhanced sampling {(LES),} and apply this approach to the well-known alpha ―{\textgreater} beta anomeric equilibrium in glucose. Although a variant of this method has been previously applied to protein stability mutations, it is particularly suited to analyze conformational equilibria in molecules such as glucose, with its many {OH} groups. This methodology allows us to more rapidly calculate complex equilibria both in vacuo and in solution. We have employed a ”generic” force field using 1,1-dimethoxymethane and 1,1-dihydroxymethane as models to derive the torsional parameters associated with {O-C-O-C} and {O-C-O-H} fragments. Within this model, we can definitively establish the magnitude of intramolecular and solvation contributions to the alpha ―{\textgreater} beta equilibrium. Specifically, we find that in vacuo glucose prefers to be in the alpha configuration by similar to 0.5-1.0 kcal/mol (predominantly because of the gauche tendency of the {O-C-O-C} linkage), and it is the solvation free energy which drives the equilibrium to the beta form {(Delta} G in solution = -0.2 kcal/mol calculated, -0.3 kcal/mol experimental). Using the {LES} approach, which reduces barriers to conformational transitions, we obtain free energies converged (compared to longer calculations) within 0.2 kcal/mol in 200 ps, both in vacuo and in water. Convergence for the single-copy method is considerably slower; variations in the calculated free energy of over 1 kcal/mol in vacuo and 0.5 kcal/mol in water are still observed in simulations of several nanoseconds in length. Thus, it appears that {LES} can be at least an order of magnitude faster to converge than single-copy methods.},

topologically distinct tautomeric forms. Only 11 of these forms for each enantiomer can be distinguished by selected computational
software commonly used to estimate octanol–water partition coefficients and/or ionization constants. The history of studies
on warfarin tautomerism is reviewed, along with the implications of tautomerism to its biological properties (activity, protein

presented.},

The density, enthalpy of mixing, free enthalpy of urea hydration, and urea diffusion show very good agreement with the experimental values. The experimental error in the free enthalpy of hydration, which is dominated by the inaccuracy of the Vapor pressure of solid urea, is larger than the simulation error. This limited accuracy does not allow a check of the nonideality of the solution. Free enthalpies have been obtained by thermodynamic integration. The importance of a correct use of the combinatorial factor in the partition function when interpreting simulation results obtained by thermodynamic integration is discussed. The tested, {GROMOS96} compatible, force field parameters form a good basis for biomolecular simulations using urea-water mixtures.},

Such methods are also likely to be directly applicable to the design and optimization of liposomal delivery systems. {MD} simulations are particularly valuable in addressing issues that are difficult to explore in laboratory experiments due to the heterogeneity of lipid bilayer membranes at the molecular level. Insights emerging from {MD} simulations are contributing to an understanding of which regions within bilayers are most and least favored by solutes at equilibrium as the solute structure is varied, local diffusivities of permeants, and the origin of the amplified selectivity to permeant size imposed by lipid bilayer membranes, particularly as changes in composition increase acyl chain ordering.},

One method is based on Jarzynski's identity {[Phys.} Rev. Lett. 78, 2690 (1997)]. The second method relies on thermodynamic integration of the average force and is called the adaptive biasing force method {[Darve} and Pohorille, J. Chem. Phys. 115, 9169 (2001)]. Both methods are designed such that the system evolves along the chosen coordinate(s) without experiencing free energy barriers and they require calculating the instantaneous, unconstrained force acting on this coordinate using the formula derived by Darve and Pohorille. Efficiencies are analyzed by comparing analytical estimates of statistical errors and by considering two numerical examples-internal rotation of hydrated 1,2-dichloroethane and transfer of fluoromethane across a water-hexane interface. The efficiencies of both methods are approximately equal in the first but not in the second case. During transfer of fluoromethane the system is easily driven away from equilibrium and, therefore, the performance of the method based on Jarzynski's identity is poor.},

It is shown that the simple spherical cutoff method used in the original simulations to find optimized parameters of this five-site model yields results that differ from those obtained by both the Ewald summation and reaction field methods. Consequently, the pivot property to which the parameters were adjusted, the location of the density maximum at 1 atm, does not agree with experimental values.

	volume = {21},
	copyright = {(c)2004 Institute for Scientific Information, Inc.},
	abstract = {In this study, we present conformational energies for a molecular mechanical model {(Parm99)} developed for organic and biological molecules using the restrained electrostatic potential {(RESP)} approach to derive the partial charges. This approach uses the simple “generic” force field model {(Parm94),} and attempts to add a minimal number of extra Fourier components to the torsional energies, but doing so only when there is a physical justification. The results are quite encouraging, not only for the 34-molecule set that has been studied by both the highest level ab initio model {(GVB/LMP2)} and experiment, but also for the 55-molecule set for which high-quality experimental data are available. Considering the 55 molecules studied by all the force field models for which there are experimental data, the average absolute errors {(AAEs)} are 0.28 (this model), 0.52 {(MM3),} 0.57 {(CHARMm} {[MSI]),} and 0.43 kcal/mol {(MMFF).} For the 34-molecule set, the {AAEs} of this model versus experiment and nb initio are 0.28 and 0.27 kcal/mol, respectively. This is a lower error than found with {MM3} and {CHARMm,} and is comparable to that found with {MMFF} (0.31 and 0.22 kcal/mol). We also present two examples of how well the torsional parameters are transferred from the training set to the test set. The absolute errors of molecules in the test set are only slightly larger than in the training set (differences of {\textless}0.1 kcal/mol). Therefore, it can be concluded that a simple “generic” force field with a limited number of specific torsional parameters can describe intra- and intermolecular interactions, although all comparison molecules were selected from our 82-compound training set. We also show how this effective two-body model can be extended for use with a nonadditive force field {(NAFF),} both with and without lone pairs. Without changing the torsional parameters, the use of more accurate charges and polarization leads to an increase in average absolute error compared with experiment, but adjustment of the parameters restores the level of agreement found with the additive model. After reoptimizing the psi, Phi torsional parameters in peptides using alanine dipeptide (6 conformational pairs) and alanine tetrapeptide (11 conformational pairs), the new model gives better energies than the Cornell et al. {(J} Am Chem Soc 1995, 117, 5179-5197) force field. The average absolute error of this model for high-level nb initio calculation is 0.82 kcal/mol for alanine dipeptide and tetrapeptide as compared with 1.80 kcal/mol for the Cornell et al. model. For nucleosides, the new model also gives improved energies compared with the Cornell et al. model. To optimize force field parameters, we developed a program called parmscan, which can iteratively scan the torsional parameters in a systematic manner and finally obtain the best torsional potentials. Besides the organic molecules in our test set, parmscan was also successful in optimizing the Psi, Phi torsional parameters in peptides to significantly improve agreement between molecular mechanical and high-level nb initio energies. {(C)} 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

We used single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to probe the interactions between {RT} and nucleic acid substrates in real time. {RT} was observed to slide on nucleic acid duplexes, rapidly shuttling between opposite termini of the duplex. Upon reaching the {DNA} 3' terminus, {RT} can spontaneously flip into a polymerization orientation. Sliding kinetics were regulated by cognate nucleotides and {anti-HIV} drugs, which stabilized and destabilized the polymerization mode, respectively.

For each complex, a single conformation of the inhibitor was selected using principal component analysis {(PCA)} for the scores obtained by the eight functions {SCORE,} {LUDI,} {GRID,} {PMF\_Score,} {D\_Score,} {G\_Score,} {ChemScore,} and {F\_Score.} Binding affinities were estimated based on partial least-squares projections onto latent structures {(PLS)} on the eight scores of each se lected: inhibitor conformation. By use of this procedure, R-2 = 0.78 and Q(2) = 0.78 were obtained when comparing experimental and calculated binding affinities. {MultiSelect} was evaluated by applying the same method for selecting docked conformations for 18 different protein-ligand;complexes of known three-dimensional structure. In all cases, the selected ligand conformations were found to be very similar to the experimentally determined ligand conformations. A more general evaluation of {MultiScore} was pe rformed using a set of 120 different protein-ligand complexes for which both the three-dimensional structures and the binding affinities were known. This approach: allowed an evaluation of {MultiScore} independently of {MultiSelect.} The generality of the met hod was verified by obtaining Q(2) = 0.68 and Q(2) = 0.67, when comparing calculated and experimental binding affinities for the 120 X-ray structures. In all cases, {LUDI,} {SCORE,} {GRID,} and {F\_Score} were included as important functions, whereas the fifth fun ction was {PMF\_Score} and {ChemScore} for the {MMP} and X-ray models, respectively.},

The results show that the lateral mobility of the adsorbed desmopressin is approximately equal to zero and the value of the lateral transport coefficient of the biomolecule in the liquid layers located above the adsorbed layer increases as the distance of the liquid layer from the charged solid surface increases. But the values of the lateral transport coefficient of the biomolecule in the liquid layers above the adsorbed layer are lower in magnitude than the value of the transport coefficient of desmopressin along the direction normal to the charged solid surface in the liquid phase located above the vacant charged sites of the solid surface, and these differences in the values of the transport coefficients have important implications with respect to the replenishment of the biomolecules in the inner parts of a channel (pore), the overall rate of adsorption, and the form of the constitutive equations that would have to be used in macroscopic models to describe the mechanisms of mass transfer and adsorption in the pores of adsorbent media. Furthermore, a novel method is presented in this work that utilizes the information about the sizes of the conformations of the biomolecule in the adsorbed layer and in the liquid layers above the adsorbed layer along the direction that is normal to the charged solid surface, as well as the number and size of the hydration layers along the same direction, and could be used to estimate the value of the lower bound of the linear characteristic dimension of a pore (i.e., pore radius) in porous adsorbent media (e.g., porous adsorbent particles; skeletons of porous monoliths) in order to realize effective transport and overall adsorption rate.},

They are derived from: (1) observed pairing frequencies of the 20 amino acids in databases of known protein structures, and (2) approximations and assumptions about the physical process that these quantities measure. Using exact lattice models, we construct a rigorous test of these assumptions and approximations. We find that statistical potentials often correctly rank-order the relative strengths of interresidue interactions, but they do not reflect the true underlying energies because of systematic errors arising from the neglect of excluded volume in proteins. We find that complex residue-residue distance dependences observed in statistical potentials, even those among charged groups, can be largely explained as an indirect consequence of the burial of non-polar groups. Our results suggest that current statistical potentials may have limited value in protein folding algorithms and wherever they are used to provide energy-like quantities.},

	doi = {10.1063/1.2949815},
	abstract = {Recently, accelerated molecular dynamics {(AMD)} technique was generalized to realize essential energy space random walks so that further sampling enhancement and effective localized enhanced sampling could be achieved. This method is especially meaningful when essential coordinates of the target events are not priori known; moreover, the energy space metadynamics method was also introduced so that biasing free energy functions can be robustly generated. Despite the promising features of this method, due to the nonequilibrium nature of the metadynamics recursion, it is challenging to rigorously use the data obtained at the recursion stage to perform equilibrium analysis, such as free energy surface mapping; therefore, a large amount of data ought to be wasted. To resolve such problem so as to further improve simulation convergence, as promised in our original paper, we are reporting an alternate approach: the adaptive-length self-healing {(ALSH)} strategy for {AMD} simulations; this development is based on a recent self-healing umbrella sampling method. Here, the unit simulation length for each self-healing recursion is increasingly updated based on the {Wang-Landau} flattening judgment. When the unit simulation length for each update is long enough, all the following unit simulations naturally run into the equilibrium regime. Thereafter, these unit simulations can serve for the dual purposes of recursion and equilibrium analysis. As demonstrated in our model studies, by applying {ALSH,} both fast recursion and short nonequilibrium data waste can be compromised. As a result, combining all the data obtained from all the unit simulations that are in the equilibrium regime via the weighted histogram analysis method, efficient convergence can be robustly ensured, especially for the purpose of free energy surface mapping.

A new Hamiltonian-replica exchange molecular dynamics {(H-RexMD)} method has been designed that effectively combines information extracted from an {ENM} analysis with atomic-resolution {MD} simulations. The {ENM} analysis is used to construct a distance-dependent penalty (flooding or biasing) potential that can drive the structure away from its current conformation in directions compatible with the {ENM} model. Various levels of the penalty or biasing potential are added to the force field description of the {MD} simulation along the replica coordinate. One replica runs at the original force field. By focusing the penalty potential on the relevant soft degrees of freedom the method avoids the rapid increase of the replica number with increasing system size to cover a desired temperature range in conventional (temperature) {RexMD} simulations. The application to domain motions in lysozyme of bacteriophage T4 and to peptide folding indicates significantly improved conformational sampling compared to conventional {MD} simulations.},

	abstract = {The transferable potentials for phase equilibria-united atom {(TraPPE-UA)} force field for hydrocarbons is extended to primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols by introducing the following (pseudo-)atoms:  common hydroxyl O and H for all alcohols, {α-CH3,} {α-CH2,} {α-CH,} and {α-C} for methanol, primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols, respectively. In the {TraPPE-UA} force field, the nonbonded interactions of these sites are governed by {Lennard−Jones} 12−6 potentials and Coulombic interactions of fixed partial charges. The values of these partial charges were borrowed from the optimized potentials for liquid simulations-united atom {(OPLS−UA)} force field {[Jorgensen,} W. L. J. Phys. Chem. 1986, 90, 1276]. The {Lennard−Jones} well depth and size parameters for the new interaction sites were determined by fitting to the single-component vapor−liquid-phase equilibria of a few selected model compounds. Although the well-depth parameters for the α-carbons could be taken directly from the {TraPPE-UA} parameters for the corresponding pseudoatoms in alkanes, the size parameters required small adjustments to reflect the differences in {C−C} and {C−O} bond lengths and the reduced electron density for α-carbons. Coupled−decoupled configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in the Gibbs and grand-canonical ensembles were carried out to calculate the one-component vapor−liquid coexistence curves for methanol, ethanol, propan-1-ol, propan-2-ol, butan-2-ol, 2-methylpropan-2-ol, pentan-1-ol, pentane-1,5-diol, and octan-1-ol, and to determine the binary phase diagrams for the mixtures of n-hexane/methanol and n-hexane/ethanol. It was found that the phase equilibria of the pure alcohols are accurately described by the {TraPPE-UA} force field, with mean unsigned deviations of about 1\% from the experimental data for the normal boiling points and the saturated liquid densities. The azeotropic compositions for n-hexane/methanol and n-hexane/ethanol were predicted to be 0.340 at T = 448.15 K and 0.454 at 413.15 K and (in mole fraction of n-hexane), which are in good agreement with the experimental results of 0.288 and 0.440, respectively. Analysis of the structures of the n-hexane/methanol mixtures shows evidence for significant enhancements in the local mole fraction of alcohols in the vicinity of other alcohols. The magnitude of these local enhancements decreases with increasing alcohol concentration, but the change is gradual and no discontinuity was observed at the azeotropic composition.},

	abstract = {A systematic multiscale coarse-graining {(MS-CG)} algorithm is applied to build coarse-grained models for monosaccharides in aqueous solution. The methodology is demonstrated for the example of α-d-glucopyranose. The nonbonded interactions are directly derived from the force-matching approach, whereas the bonded interactions are obtained through Boltzmann statistical analyses of the underlying atomistic trajectory. The {MS-CG} model is shown to reproduce many structural and thermodynamic properties in the constant {NPT} ensemble. Although the model is derived at a single temperature, pressure, and concentration, it is shown to be reasonably transferable to other thermodynamic states. In this model, long-range interactions are effectively mapped into short-range forces with a moderate cutoff and are evaluated by table look-up. As a result, molecular dynamics employing the {MS-CG} model is ∼3 orders of magnitude more efficient than its atomistic counterpart. Consequently, the model is particularly suitable for simulating carbohydrate systems at large length and long time scales. Results for an α-(1→4)-d-glucan with 14 glucose units are also presented, demonstrating that the {MS-CG} algorithm is also applicable to the coarse-graining of other saccharide systems.},

The analysi s reveals differences in the binding energy landscapes of two molecular fragments with the {FKBP12} protein, which are reflected in their characteristic transition temperatures. The approach provides insight into the nature of transitions between unbound an d bound phases of ligand-protein complexes. One molecular fragment proceeds from the unbound phase to the native complex via a short-lived intermediate at relatively high temperature. The second fragment has a significantly more rugged binding energy land scape and goes from unbound to a long-lived nonspecific bound species consisting of isoenergetic yet structurally different binding modes, and later via a second-order-like transition to the native complex. Emerging universalities in molecular recognition and protein folding mechanisms are highlighted in the context of the kinetic partitioning mechanism. {(C)} 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

Its results compare favorably with those of annealing and parallel tempering simulations, which have been used before in the same context.

In our simulations, polyelectrolytes were modeled by chains of charged {Lennard-Jones} particles with explicit counterions. We have studied the effects of the surface charge density, surface charge distribution, solvent quality for the polymer backbone, strength of the short-range interactions between polymers and substrates on the polymer surface coverage, and the thickness of the adsorbed layer. The polymer surface coverage monotonically increases with increasing surface charge density for almost all studied systems except for the system of hydrophilic polyelectrolytes adsorbing at hydrophilic surfaces. In this case the polymer surface coverage saturates at high surface charge densities. This is due to additional monomer−monomer repulsion between adsorbed polymer chains, which becomes important in dense polymeric layers. These interactions also preclude surface overcharging by hydrophilic polyelectrolytes at high surface charge densities. The thickness of the adsorbed layer shows monotonic dependence on the surface charge density for the systems of hydrophobic polyelectrolytes for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. Thickness is a decreasing function of the surface charge density in the case of hydrophilic surfaces while it increases with the surface charge density for hydrophobic substrates. Qualitatively different behavior is observed for the thickness of the adsorbed layer of hydrophilic polyelectrolytes at hydrophilic surfaces. In this case, thickness first decreases with increasing surface charge density, then it begins to increase.},

All the structures were solved from single crystal X-ray data, except for Form {IV,} which was solved using conventional powder X-ray diffraction {(PXRD)} data. The conformational differences in the {TB} molecule arise primarily from torsional variations in the alkyl tail which result in two types of conformers {(U} and chair). The packing differences are mainly due to the orientation of adjacent molecules in the hydrogen bonding networks. Based on the {DSC} data, thermodynamic stability relationships of polymorphic pairs were evaluated and graphically visualized in a schematic energy-temperature diagram. Form {II} is found to be the thermodynamically stable polymorph from absolute zero to sim353 K and beyond which Form {IH} is the stable polymorph. The anisotropic lattice contraction of {TB} polymorphs which resulted in severe variations in {PXRD} patterns at ambient and low temperature was highlighted. The present work also highlights and resolves several discrepancies in the published data on the structural and thermodynamic features of {TB} polymorphs. © 2010 {Wiley-Liss,} Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 99:2975-2990, 2010},

The method is valid for deterministic or stochastic Markov dynamics and for stationary or time-dependent distributions. A practical {Rayleigh-Ritz} procedure is advanced, whose inputs are a finitely parametrized Ansatz for the trial states, leading to a parametric action for their evolution. The {Euler-Lagrange} equations of the action principle are Hamiltonian in form generally noncanonical. This permits a simple identification of fixed points as critical points of the parametric Hamiltonian. We also establish a variational principle for low-order statistics, such as mean values and correlation functions, by means of the least effective action. The latter is a functional of the given variable, which is positive and convex as a consequence of Holder realizability inequalities. Its value measures the cost for a fluctuation from the average to occur and in a weak-noise limit it reduces to the {Onsager-Machlup} action. In general, the effective action is shown to arise from the nonequilibrium action functional by a constrained variation. This result provides a {Rayleigh-Ritz} scheme for calculating just the desired low-order statistics, with internal consistency checks less demanding than for the full distribution.},

The method is applied to the calculation of the liquid-gas coexistence envelope for the pure {Lennard-Jones} (6, 12) fluid for several reduced temperatures from the vicinity of the triple point to close to the critical point ( T * = 0·75 to T * = 1·30).
