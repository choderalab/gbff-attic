Quantitative structural characterization of chromatographic media has generally been performed in terms of the mean pore size or, at best, the pore size distribution {(PSD),} but more detailed information on, e.g., connectivity has been lacking. We have applied electron tomography, a {3D} {TEM} technique that views a sample from multiple perspectives and allows reconstruction of the volumetric structure, to capture the internal details of microporous chromatographic media with nanometer-scale resolution. Visualization of reconstructions of three adsorbents, Toyopearl {SP-650} C, {SP-550} C, and {CM} Sepharose {FF,} provides thorough and direct information on the geometry and the interconnectivity of the pore network. The structures are qualitatively consistent with in situ {AFM} images, and quantitative data for the porosities and {PSDs} from the analysis of tomographic data agree reasonably well with inverse size-exclusion chromatography results. For a more straightforward representation of the networking and size features of the disordered pore space, a {3D} thinning algorithm was used to derive pore skeletons and consequently quantitative data on distributions of local path lengths, widths, tortuosities, and connectivities. Such enriched structural information can be instrumental in more discriminate structural evaluation and construction of engineered pore models for the study of solute intraparticle transport.},

	abstract = {We present an extension of the {CHARMM} hexopyranose monosaccharide additive all-atom force field to enable modeling of glycosidic-linked hexopyranose polysaccharides. The new force field parameters encompass 1→1, 1→2, 1→3, 1→4, and 1→6 hexopyranose glycosidic linkages, as well as O-methylation at the C1 anomeric carbon, and are developed to be consistent with the {CHARMM} all-atom biomolecular force fields for proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. The parameters are developed in a hierarchical fashion using model compounds containing the key atoms in the full carbohydrates, in particular O-methyl-tetrahydropyran and glycosidic-linked dimers consisting of two molecules of tetrahyropyran or one molecule of tetrahydropyran and one of cyclohexane. Target data for parameter optimization include full two-dimensional energy surfaces defined by the Φ/Ψ glycosidic dihedral angles in the disaccharide analogs, as determined by quantum mechanical {MP2/cc-pVTZ} single point energies on {MP2/6-31G(d)} optimized structures {(MP2/cc-pVTZ//MP2/6-31G(d)).} In order to achieve balanced, transferable dihedral parameters for the Φ/Ψ glycosidic dihedral angles, surfaces for all possible chiralities at the ring carbon atoms involved in the glycosidic linkages are considered, resulting in over 5 000 {MP2/cc-pVTZ//MP2/6-31G(d)} conformational energies. Also included as target data are vibrational frequencies, pair interaction energies and distances with water molecules, and intramolecular geometries including distortion of the glycosidic valence angle as a function of the glycosidic dihedral angles. The model compound optimized force field parameters are validated on full disaccharides through the comparison of molecular dynamics results to available experimental data. Good agreement is achieved with experiment for a variety of properties including crystal cell parameters and intramolecular geometries, aqueous densities, and aqueous {NMR} coupling constants associated with the glycosidic linkage. The newly developed parameters allow for the modeling of linear, branched, and cyclic hexopyranose glycosides both alone and in heterogeneous systems including proteins, nucleic acids, and/or lipids when combined with existing {CHARMM} biomolecular force fields.},

	abstract = {Thermodynamic integration is a widely used method to calculate and analyze the effect of a chemical modification on the free energy of a chemical or biochemical process, for example, the impact of an amino acid substitution on protein association. Numerical fluctuations can introduce large uncertainties, limiting the domain of application of the method. The parametric energy function describing the chemical modification in the thermodynamic integration, the “alchemical path”, determines the amplitudes of the fluctuations. In the present work, I propose a measure of the fluctuations in the thermodynamic integration and an approach to search for a parametric energy path minimizing that measure. The optimal path derived with this approach is very close to the theoretical minimum of the measure, but produces nonergodic sampling. Nevertheless, this path is used to guide the design of a practical and efficient path producing correct sampling. The convergence with this practical path is evaluated on test cases, and compares favorably with that of other methods such as power or polynomial path, soft-core van der Waals, and some other approaches presented in the literature.

The average absolute error for the former was 2.9 {kJ} mol(-1) and for the latter was 3.5 {kJ} mol(-1). The linear response method was then used to predict free energies of hydration based on the average van der Waals and electrostatic solute-solvent energies obtained from Monte Carlo computer simulations and solvent accessible surface areas. Use of the three parameter relationship gave a good agreement with the experiment. However, a number of simpler fitting functions were also examined and found to be only marginally less reliable. A careful statistical analysis of the linear response method is therefore needed. {(C)} 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

The free energy perturbation {(FEP)} methodology is the most accurate means of estimating relative binding affinities between two inhibitors. However, due to its complexity and computation-intensive nature, practical applications are restricted to analysis of structurally-related inhibitors. Accordingly, there is a need for methods that enable rapid assessment of a large number of structurally-unrelated molecules in a suitably accurate manner. In this review, the {FEP} method is compared with molecular mechanics {(MM)} methods to assess the advantages of each in the estimation of relative binding affinities of inhibitors to an enzyme. Qualitative predictions of relative binding free energies of fructose 1, 6-bisphosphatase inhibitors using {MM} methods are discussed and compared with the corresponding {FEP} results. The results indicate that the {MM} based methods and the {FEP} method are useful in the qualitative and quantitative assessment of relative binding affinities of enzyme inhibitors, respectively, prior to synthesis.},

While such models have been invoked previously, this mesoscopic description is augmented here by miscroscopic models for representing surface diffusion by ”hopping” and adsorption within a Gibbs surface excess formulation. These contributions lead to a relation for the apparent protein diffusivity as a function of adsorption conditions, which can be used predictively with knowledge of a few readily measured physical quantities. The approach can be useful in seeking optimal conditions for preparative protein chromatography separations.},

The recent integration of optimization techniques into simulation practice, specically into commercial software, has become nearly ubiquitous, as most discrete-event simulation packages now include some form of "optimization" routine. The main thesis of this article, how-ever,is that there is a disconnect between research in simulation optimization--which has addressed the stochastic nature of discrete-event simulation by concentratingon theoretical results of convergence and specialized algorithms that are mathematically elegant--and the recent software developments, which implement very general algorithms adopted from techniques in the deterministic optimization metaheuristic literature (e.g., genetic algorithms, tabu search, artificial neural networks). A tutorial exposition that summarizes the approaches found in the research literature is included, as well as a discussion contrasting these approaches with the algorithms implemented in commercial software. The article concludes with the author's speculations on promising research areas and possible future directions in practice.},

If the developability of a drug is to be included in the lead optimization, new experimental and computational models of solubility and permeability are needed. These models must have the capacity to handle a large amount of data. Nowadays, epithelial cell culture models such as Caco-2 are routinely used to assess intestinal drug permeability and transport in drug discovery settings. The permeability values obtained from the Caco-2 cell monolayers have been traditionally used to devise in silico models for the prediction of drug absorption. In this paper, the use of molecular surface areas as descriptors of permeability and solubility will be reviewed. Moreover, a virtual filter for the prediction of oral drug developability based on the successful combination of in vitro and in silico models of drug permeability and aqueous drug solubility will be discussed.},

	abstract = {The current status of docking procedures for predicting protein-protein interactions starting from their three-dimensional {(3D)} structure is reassessed by evaluating blind predictions, performed during 2003-2004 as part of Rounds 3-5 of the community-wide experiment on Critical Assessment of {PRedicted} Interactions {(CAPRI).} Ten newly determined structures of protein-protein complexes were used as targets for these rounds. They comprised 2 enzyme-inhibitor complexes, 2 antigen-antibody complexes, 2 complexes involved in cellular signaling, 2 homo-oligomers, and a complex between 2 components of the bacterial cellulosome. For most targets, the predictors were given the experimental structures of 1 unbound and 1 bound component, with the latter in a random orientation. For some, the structure of the free component was derived from that of a related protein, requiring the use of homology modeling. In some of the targets, significant differences in conformation were displayed between the bound and unbound components, representing a major challenge for the docking procedures. For 1 target, predictions could not go to completion. In total, 1866 predictions submitted by 30 groups were evaluated. Over one-third of these groups applied completely novel docking algorithms and scoring functions, with several of them specifically addressing the challenge of dealing with side-chain and backbone flexibility. The quality of the predicted interactions was evaluated by comparison to the experimental structures of the targets, made available for the evaluation, using the well-agreed-upon criteria used previously. Twenty-four groups, which for the first time included an automatic Web server, produced predictions ranking from acceptable to highly accurate for all targets, including those where the structures of the bound and unbound forms differed substantially. These results and a brief survey of the methods used by participants of {CAPRI} Rounds 3-5 suggest that genuine progress in the performance of docking methods is being achieved, with {CAPRI} acting as the catalyst.},

The process requires discretization of one or more reaction coordinates to generate a histogram from which the continuous probability density is inferred. We show that the finite size of the intervals used to construct the histogram leads to quantifiable systematic error. The width of these intervals also determines the statistical error in the free energy, and the choice of the appropriate interval is therefore driven by the need to balance the two sources of error. We present a method for the construction of the optimal histogram for a given system, and show that the use of this technique requires little additional computational expense. We demonstrate the efficacy of the technique for a model system, and discuss how the principles governing the choice of discretization interval could be used to improve extended sampling techniques.},

	abstract = {The {HA} of influenza virus is a receptor-binding and fusion protein that is required to initiate infection. The {HA} receptor-binding domain determines the species of sialyl receptors recognized by influenza viruses. Here, we demonstrate that changes in the {HA} receptor-binding domain alter the ability of the {H5N1} virus to spread systemically in mice. The {A/Vietnam/1203/04} {(VN1203)} and {A/Hong} Kong/213/03 {(HK213)} viruses are consistently lethal to domestic chickens but differ in their pathogenicity to mammals. Insertion of the {VN1203} {HA} and neuraminidase {(NA)} genes into recombinant {HK213} virus expanded its tissue tropism and increased its lethality in mice; conversely, insertion of {HK213} {HA} and {NA} genes into recombinant {VN1203} virus decreased its systemic spread and lethality. The {VN1203} and {HK213} {HAs} differ by 10 aa, and {HK213} {HA} has shown greater binding affinity for synthetic α2,6-linked sialyl receptor. Introduction of an {S227N} change and removal of -linked glycosylation at residue 158 increased the α2,6-binding affinity of {VN1203} {HA.} Recombinant {VN1203} virus carrying the {S227N} change alone or with the residue-158 glycosylation site removed showed reduced lethality and systemic spread in mice but not in domestic chickens. Wild-type {VN1203} virus exhibited the greatest efficiency in systemic spread after intramuscular inoculation and in infection of mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and conventional pulmonary dendritic cells. These results show that {VN1203} {HA} glycoprotein confers pathogenicity by facilitating systemic spread in mice; they also suggest that a minor change in receptor binding domain may modulate the virulence of {H5N1} viruses.},

	abstract = {Abstract: We have carried out molecular dynamics {(MD)} simulations and free energy calculations on the -subtype of the human estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain {(ER} {LBD)} complexed with a number of known agonists and putative xenoestrogens. Our dynamical simulations of ligand-receptor complexes underscore the highly structured nature of the complex and offer some interesting insights into the structure-activity relationship {(SAR)} for these ligands. With traditional thermodynamic integration {(TI)} calculations, we calculate relative binding free energies for three known agonists, in good agreement with experimental values. The sheer number of possible xenoestrogenic compounds makes an approach using traditional free energy calculations unfeasible. Instead, we have made use of a single-step perturbation methodology that allows the calculation of relative free energies for a large number of related polyaromatic hydrocarbons {(PAHs)} from a single simulation. Our results show good (maximum deviation 3.3 {kJ} mol-1) agreement with experimental data, suggesting the possibility of large-scale xenoestrogen screening in silico to obtain strongly estrogenic compounds for subsequent experimental testing.},

Following the naming convention of the {AMBER} force field series, this release will be called ff02pol.rl The force field has been assessed both by energetic comparison against the {QM} data and by the replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations of short alanine peptides in water. For {Ace-Ala-Nme,} the simulated populations in the beta, {PII} and {alphaR} regions were approximately 30, 43, and 26\%, respectively. For {Ace-(Ala)7-Nme,} the populations in these three regions were approximately 24, 49, and 26\%. Both were in qualitative agreement with the {NMR} and {CD} experimental conclusions. In comparison with the previous force field, ff02pol.rl demonstrated good balance among these three important regions. The optimized torsion parameters, together with those in ff02, allow us to carry out simulations on proteins and peptides with the consideration of polarization. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The complete sequence was determined with the aid of the statistical computational design algorithm {SCADS.} The 34-residue peptide was chemically synthesized. {UVvis} and {CD} spectroscopy, size-exclusion chromatography, and analytical ultracentrifugation indicated the peptide undergoes a transition from a predominantly random coil monomer to an alpha-helical tetramer upon binding {DPPFe(III).} {EPR} spectroscopy studies indicated the axial imidazole ligands were oriented in a perpendicular fashion, as defined by second-shell interactions that were included in the design. The {1-D} {1H} {NMR} spectrum of the assembled protein displayed features of a well-packed interior. The assembled protein possessed functional redox properties different from those of structurally similar systems containing the heme cofactor. The designed peptide demonstrated remarkable cofactor selectivity with a significantly weaker binding affinity for the natural heme cofactor. These findings open a path for the selective incorporation of more elaborate cofactors into designed scaffolds for constructing molecularly well-defined nanoscale materials.},

Large library design dominated the field of lead discovery in the 1990s, with design methods ranging from arbitrary and property-based reagent selection to product-based approaches. Over time, however, there has been a downward trend in library size as the genomics revolution and the increasing availability of target protein structures from X-ray crystallography and homology modeling have increased the volume of information concerning desired targets. Concurrently, computing grids and {CPU} clusters have facilitated the development of structure-based tools that are able to screen hundreds of thousands of molecules. Smaller, 'smarter' combinatorial and focused parallel libraries have replaced the unfocused large libraries in the drug design paradigm of the 21st century. While diversity continues to play a role in lead discovery, the focus of current library design methods has shifted to scaffold design and bio-isostere searching, with a greatly needed emphasis on synthetic feasibility.},

In this united-atom force field, the nonbonded interactions of the hydrocarbon pseudo-atoms are solely governed by {Lennard-Jones} 12-6 potentials, and the {Lennard-Jones} well depth and size parameters for the new pseudoatoms were determined by fitting to the single-component vapor-liquid-phase equilibria of a few selected model compounds. Configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in the {NVT} version of the Gibbs ensemble were carried out to calculate the single-component vapor-liquid coexistence curves for ethene, propene, I-butene, trans- and cis-2-butene, 2-methylpropene, 1,5-hexadiene, 1-octene, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, propylbenzene, isopropylbenzene, o-, m-, and p-xylene, and naphthalene.

	abstract = {Aqueous solubility is an important factor influencing several aspects of the pharmacokinetic profile of a drug. Numerous publications present different methodologies for the development of reliable computational models for the prediction of solubility from structure. The quality of such models can be significantly affected by the accuracy of the employed experimental solubility data. In this work, the importance of the accuracy of the experimental solubility data used for model training was investigated. Three data sets were used as training sets - data set 1, containing solubility data collected from various literature sources using a few criteria (n = 319), data set 2, created by substituting 28 values from data set 1 with uniformly determined experimental data from one laboratory (n = 319), and data set 3, created by including 56 additional components, for which the solubility was also determined under uniform conditions in the same laboratory, in the data set 2 (n = 375). The selection of the most significant descriptors was performed by the heuristic method, using one- -parameter and multi-parameter analysis. The correlations between the most significant descriptors and solubility were established using multi-linear regression analysis {(MLR)} for all three investigated data sets. Notable differences were observed between the equations corresponding to different data sets, suggesting that models updated with new experimental data need to be additionally optimized. It was successfully shown that the inclusion of uniform experimental data consistently leads to an improvement in the correlation coefficients. These findings contribute to an emerging consensus that improving the reliability of solubility prediction requires the inclusion of many diverse compounds for which solubility was measured under standardized conditions in the data set. {[ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR]}},

Use of B-splines in place of Lagrange interpolation leads to analytic gradients as well as a significant improvement in the accuracy. We demonstrate that arbitrary accuracy can be achieved, independent of system size N, at a cost that scales as N {log(N).} For biomolecular systems with many thousands of atoms this method permits the use of Ewald summation at a computational cost comparable to that of a simple truncation method of 10 {AA} or less.

Interest in studying amines and fluorine-substituted compounds has risen from their intrinsic physicochemical properties and their prevalence in biological and pharmaceutical compounds. In the present study, a previously developed approach which optimizes {Lennard-Jones} {(LJ)} parameters via the use of rare gas atoms combined with the reproduction of experimental condensed phase properties was extended to polar-neutral compounds. Compounds studied included four amines (ammonia, methylamine, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine) and three fluoroethanes (1-fluoroethane, 1,1-difluoroethane, and 1,1,1-trifluoroethane). The resulting force field yielded heats of vaporization and molecular volumes in excellent agreement with the experiment, with average differences less than 1\%. The current amine {CHARMM} parameters successfully reproduced experimental aqueous solvation data where methylamine is more hydrophilic than ammonia. with hydrophobicity increasing with additional methylation on the nitrogen. For both the amines and fluoroethanes the parabolic relationship of the extent of methylation or fluorination, respectively, to the heats of vaporization were reproduced by the new parameters. The present results are also discussed with respect to the impact of parameterization approach to molecular details obtained from computer simulations and to the unique biological properties of fluorine in pharmaceutical compounds. {(C)} 2002 John Wiley Sons, Inc.},

In this article, we aim to address the second task by extending the likelihood approach of Kong et al. for Monte Carlo integration. We consider a general Markov chain scheme and use partial likelihood for estimation. Basically, the Markov chain scheme is treated as a random design and a stratified estimator is defined for the baseline measure. Further, we propose useful techniques including subsampling, regulation, and amplification for achieving overall computational efficiency. Finally, we introduce approximate variance estimators for the point estimators. The method can yield substantially improved accuracy compared with Chib's estimator and the crude Monte Carlo estimator, as illustrated with three examples. {(C)} 2007 Elsevier {B.V.} All rights reserved.},

Such polarization strongly affects the geometry and energetics of molecular recognition. First introduced more than 20 years ago, polarizable force fields seek to account for appropriate variations in charge distribution with dielectric environment. Over the past five years, an accelerated pace of development of such force fields has taken place on systems ranging from liquid water to metalloenzymes. Noteworthy progress has been made in better understanding the capabilities and limitations of polarizable models for water and in the formulation and utilization of complete specifically parameterized polarizable force fields for peptides and proteins.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Replica exchange molecular dynamics {(REMD)} has become a standard technique for accelerating relaxation in biosimulations. Despite its widespread use, questions remain about its efficiency compared with conventional, constant temperature molecular dynamics {(MD).} An analytic approach is taken to describe the relative efficiency of {REMD} with respect to {MD.} This is applied to several simple two-state models and to several real proteinsprotein L and the B domain of protein Ato predict the relative efficiency of {REMD} with respect to {MD} in actual applications. In agreement with others, we find the following: as long as there is a positive activation energy for folding, {REMD} is more efficient than {MD;} the effectiveness of {REMD} is strongly dependent on the activation enthalpy; and the efficiency of {REMD} for actual proteins is a strong function of the maximum temperature. Choosing the maximum temperature too high can result in {REMD} becoming significantly less efficient than conventional {MD.} A good rule of thumb appears to be to choose the maximum temperature of the {REMD} simulation slightly above the temperature at which the enthalpy for folding vanishes. Additionally, we find that the number of replicas in {REMD,} while important for simulations shorter than one or two relaxation times, has a minimal effect on the asymptotic efficiency of the method.},

A demonstration of this approach is given for the optimization of molecular electronic polarizability and hyperpolarizability. We show that the optimal structures can be determined without enumerating and separately evaluating the characteristics of the combinatorial number of possible structures, a process that would be much slower. The {LCAP} approach may be used with quantum or classical Hamiltonians, suggesting possible applications to drug design and new materials discovery.},

	abstract = {Abstract  Finding the most stable tautomer or a set of low-energy tautomers of molecules is critical in many aspects of molecular modelling
or virtual screening experiments. Enumeration of low-energy tautomers of neutral molecules in the gas-phase or typical solvents
can be performed by applying available organic chemistry knowledge. This kind of enumeration is implemented in a number of
software packages and it is relatively reliable. However, in esoteric cases such as charged molecules in uncommon, non-aqueous
solvents there is simply not enough available knowledge to make reliable predictions of low energy tautomers. Over the last
few years we have been developing an approach to address the latter problem and we successfully applied it to discover the
most stable anionic tautomers of nucleic acid bases that might be involved in the process of {DNA} damage by low-energy electrons
and in charge transfer through {DNA.} The approach involves three steps: (1) combinatorial generation of a library of tautomers,
(2) energy-based screening of the library using electronic structure methods, and (3) analysis of the information generated
in step (2). In steps 1–3 we employ combinatorial, computational and chemoinformatics techniques, respectively. Therefore,
this hybrid approach is named {“Combinatorial*Computational*Chemoinformatics”,} or just abbreviated as C3 (or C-cube) approach. This article summarizes our developments and most interesting methodological aspects of the C3 approach. It can serve as an example how to identify the most stable tautomers of molecular systems for which common chemical
knowledge had not been sufficient to make definite predictions.},

Free-energy calculations based on classical molecular-dynamics simulations of the protein and from mutants in aqueous solution at different {pH} values were used to compute relative redox potentials. The precision of the free-energy calculations with the ? coupling-parameter approach is evaluated as function of the number and sequence of ? values, the sampling time and initial conditions. It is found that the precision is critically dependent on the relaxation of hydrogen-bonding networks when changing the atomic-charge distribution due to a change of redox state or {pH} value. The errors in the free energies range from 1 to 10 {kBT,} depending on the type of process. Only qualitative estimates of the change in redox potential by protein mutation can be obtained.},

	abstract = {A theory was developed to describe the equilibrium partitioning of flexible, linear polymers between a concentrated polymer solution and a medium consisting of a randomly oriented array of fibers (e.g., a fibrous membrane or gel). The fibers were represented as long cylinders, and the solute was modeled as a chain of cylindrical segments joined at specified bond angles. A Monte Carlo technique combined with excluded-volume concepts was used to describe steric interactions among chains and between chains and fibers. The partition coefficient {(Phi,} the solute concentration in the fibrous material divided by that in the bulk solution) was predicted to increase markedly when the bulk solution concentration of the polymer was elevated. This sensitivity of Phi to bulk concentration was found even at concentrations that were well below critical overlap values. The predicted partition coefficient decreased significantly as fiber volume fraction or molecular size was increased but tended to be less sensitive to the structural details of the chain (segment number, segment radius, and bond angle). Partition coefficients for dextran in agarose gels were measured as a function of agarose volume fraction, dextran size, and dextran concentration. The trends in the data were in good agreement with the theory. Over the range of dextran concentrations studied, as much as a 5-fold increase in Phi was observed.},

@article{givon_extracting_????,
	title = {Extracting macroscopic dynamics: Model problems and algorithms},
	abstract = {In many applications, the primary objective of numerical simulation of time-evolving systems is the prediction of macroscopic, or coarse-grained, quantities. A representative example is the prediction of biomolecular conformations from molecular dynamics. In recent years a number of new algorithmic approaches have been introduced to extract effective, lower-dimensional, models for the macroscopic dynamics; the starting point is the full, detailed, evolution equations. In many cases the effective low-dimensional dynamics may be stochastic, even when the original starting point is deterministic. This review surveys a number of these new approaches to the problem of extracting effective dynamics, highlighting similarities and differences between them. The importance of model problems for the evaluation of these new approaches is stressed, and a number of model problems are described. When the macroscopic dynamics is stochastic, these model problems are either obtained through a clear separation of time-scales, leading to a stochastic effect of the fast dynamics on the slow dynamics, or by considering high dimensional ordinary differential equations which, when projected onto a low dimensional subspace, exhibit stochastic behaviour through the presence of a broad frequency spectrum. Models whose stochastic microscopic behaviour leads to deterministic macroscopic dynamics are also introduced. The algorithms we overview include {SVD-based} methods for nonlinear problems, model reduction for linear control systems, optimal prediction techniques, asymptotics-based mode elimination, coarse timestepping methods and transfer-operator based methodologies.},

In this paper, we summarize the prediction attained with the proposed neural network structure referred to as the Orthogonal Functional Basis Neural Network {(OFBNN).} The {OFBNN,} which combines a new basis selection process and a regularization technique, not only gives us a more computationally tractable method, but better generalization performance.

One consequence of the accelerated {R\&D} paradigm is a blurring of the traditional discovery-development interface, which in turn impacts the traditional roles of discovery and development scientists. {R\&D} organizations must find ways to screen out rapidly compounds that have relatively poor probability of successful registration. Quality of development candidates can be favorably influenced by early consideration of ldquodevelopabilityrdquo criteria along with receptor-based potency and specificity. Computational approaches and/or high-throughput experimental determinations will be used increasingly to profile compound characteristics which influence ldquodevelopability.rdquo If such criteria are considered at the time of lead selection and optimization, the compound attrition rate during later development should be decreased from the historical norm. This article discusses the emerging role of development scientists during small-molecule lead selection and optimization.

However, isocratic retention experiments reveal that the larger proteins can be almost completely excluded from the dextran layer at high ionic strengths, potentially leading to significant losses in static capacity at relevant column loading conditions. Knowledge of resin and protein properties is used to estimate physical limits on the static capacities of the resins in order to provide a meaningful interpretation of the observed static capacities. Results of such estimates are consistent with the expectation that available surface area is limiting for traditional resins. In dextran-modified media, however, the volume of the dextran layer appears to limit adsorption when the protein charge is low relative to the resin charge, but the protein-resin electroneutrality may be limiting when the protein charge is relatively high. Such analyses may prove useful for semiquantitative prediction of maximum static capacities and selection of operating conditions when combined with protein transport information.},

from the whole combinatorial library, this study tried to predict {PAMPA} permeability with in silico descriptors. Log P, {pK}
a, and polar surface areas {(PSA)} as a hydrogen-bonding descriptor were calculated by commercially available or free-accessible
web programs. Five-fold cross-validations and conventional regression analyses were examined with the training set for the
entire 81 combinations with nine log P, three {pK}
a and three {PSA} descriptors. By comparison of statistical indices, four equations were selected and then the model with the
best combination of in silico descriptors was determined based on the external validation. The {PAMPA} prediction equation obtained
in this report could be applied for the prediction of both Caco-2 cell permeability and human intestinal absorption of mainly
passively-transported drugs.},

	abstract = {The sensitivity of aqueous solvation free energies {(SFEs),} estimated using the {GB/SA} continuum solvent model, on charge sets, protocols, and force fields, was studied. Simple energy calculations using the {GB/SA} solvent model were performed on 11 monofunctional organic compounds. Results indicate that calculated {SFEs} are strongly dependent on the charge sets. Charges derived from electrostatic potential fitting to high level ab initio wave functions using the {CHELPG} procedure and ”class {IV”} charges from {AM1/CM1a} or {PM3/CM1p} calculations yielded better results than the corresponding Mulliken charges. Calculated {SFEs} were similar to {MC/FEP} energies obtained in the presence of explicit {TIP4P} water. Further improvements were obtained by using {GVB/6-31G**} and {MP2/6-31} G** {(CHELPG)} charge sets that included correlation effects. {SFEs} calculated using charge sets assigned by the {OPLSA*} force field gave the best results of all standard force fields {(MM2*,} {MM3*,} {MMFF,} {AMBER*,} and {OPLSA*)} implemented in {MacroModel.} Comparison of relative and absolute {SFEs} computed using either the {GB/SA} continuum model or {MC/FEP} calculations in the presence of explicit {TIP4P} water showed that, in general, relative {SFEs} can be estimated with greater accuracy. A second set of 20 mono-and difunctional molecules was also studied and relative {SFEs} estimated using energy minimization and thermodynamic cycle perturbation {(TCP)} protocols. {SFEs} calculated from {TCP} calculations using the {GB/SA} model were sensitive to bond lengths of dummy bonds (i.e., bonds involving dummy atoms). In such cases, keeping the bond lengths of dummy bonds close to the corresponding bond lengths of the starting structures improved the agreement of {TCP-calculated} {SFEs} with energy minimization results. Overall, these results indicate that {GB/SA} solvation free energy estimates from simple energy minimization calculations are of similar accuracy and value to those obtained using more elaborate {TCP} protocols. {(C)} 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

This can be done by expressing calculated free energies as a sum of components that correspond to the contributions of different energy terms or different parts of the system.

We show that a linear coupling scheme for the alchemical creation of a chemical identity corresponds to a particularly useful path because it leads to a symmetric decoupling of the free energy components. The path dependence also provides an additional degree of freedom that can be used to study different processes.

	abstract = {The evolution of antiretroviral drug resistance is a major problem in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 {(HIV-1)} infection. Drug therapy failure is associated with accumulation of drug resistance mutations and results in the development of drug resistance. Drugs targeted against reverse transcriptase {(RT)} as well as drug-resistant {RT} have been shown to increase {HIV-1} mutation frequencies. Furthermore, combinations of drug and drug-resistant {RT} can increase virus mutation frequencies in a multiplicative manner. The evolution of drug resistance also alters virus fitness. The correlation of increased {HIV-1} mutation rates with the evolution of antiretroviral drug resistance indicates that drug failure could increase the likelihood of further resistance evolving from subsequent drug regimens. These observations parallel studies from microbial systems that provide evidence for a correlation between drug resistance development and increased pathogen mutation rates. Although increased mutant frequencies may be detrimental to effective therapy, the lethal mutagenesis of the {HIV-1} genome may provide a new means for antiretroviral therapy. {[ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR]}},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.0709322104},
	abstract = {{ATP} synthase uses a unique rotary mechanism to couple {ATP} synthesis and hydrolysis to transmembrane proton translocation. The F1 subcomplex has three catalytic nucleotide binding sites, one on each [beta] subunit, with widely differing affinities for {MgATP} or {MgADP.} During rotational catalysis, the sites switch their affinities. The affinity of each site is determined by the position of the central gamma subunit. The site with the highest nucleotide binding affinity is catalytically active. From the available x-ray structures, it is not possible to discern the high-affinity site. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer between tryptophan residues engineered into gamma and trinitrophenyl nucleotide analogs on the catalytic sites, we were able to determine that the high-affinity site is close to the C-terminal helix of gamma, but at considerable distance from its N terminus. Thus, the {[beta]TP} site in the x-ray structure {[Abrahams} {JP,} Leslie {AGW,} Lutter R, Walker {JE} (1994) Nature 370:621628] is the high-affinity site, in agreement with the prediction of Yang et al. {[Yang} W, Gao {YQ,} Cui Q, Ma J, Karplus M (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci {USA} 100:874879]. Taking into account the known direction of rotation, the findings establish the sequence of affinities through which each catalytic site cycles during {MgATP} hydrolysis as low [-{\textbackslash}{\textgreater}] high [-{\textbackslash}{\textgreater}] medium [-{\textbackslash}{\textgreater}] low. 10.1073/pnas.0709322104},

The example problem shows that when an instance of the process is analyzed under the assumption that the underlying states have been aggregated into macrostates, a procedure known as lumping, the resulting chain appears to have been produced by a {non-Markovian} process when viewed at high temporal resolution. However, when viewed on longer time scales, and for appropriately lumped macrostates, Markovian behavior can be recovered. The potential for extracting the long time scale behavior of the folding process from a large number of short, independent molecular dynamics simulations is also explored.},

This has been especially true of electrostatically driven adsorption, for which colloidal models have been used frequently. These efforts have focused on adsorption of proteins to oppositely charged surfaces and often capture the experimental trends even with gross simplification of protein structure. As a more stringent test of model sensitivity to structural details, we have modeled the patch-controlled adsorption of basic proteins on anion-exchange surfaces, where a small number of negative charges on the protein surface lead to a net attraction between the net positively charged protein and the positively charged surface. We account in detail for the protein shape and charge distribution and examine the role of the assumed surface description. A model assuming a uniformly charged surface is unable to predict electrostatically driven adsorption observed experimentally, whereas models accounting for the discreteness of charge on the adsorbent are able to explain some of the anomalous experimental trends. Although our results show that fine details of the models are crucial in correctly describing adsorption behavior under these unusual conditions, they also suggest that when the protein and the surface are oppositely charged, model calculations can be quite robust to model idealizations.},

	abstract = {{HIV} reverse transcriptase {(RT)} is the target of a number of important {anti-AIDS} drugs. Drugs that inhibit {RT} are either nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors {(NRTIs)} or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors {(NNRTIs).} Combinations of various {anti-AIDS} drugs (highly active anti-retroviral therapies or {HAART)} can reduce the viral load to non-detectable levels. However, the development of drug resistance leads to the emergence of {HIV} strains that are resistant to multiple {anti-AIDS} drugs. The nucleotide analogs that are used as {anti-HIV-1} drugs lack the normal {3'-OH} and as a consequence act as chain-terminators when incorporated into {DNA.} One mechanism of nucleoside analog resistance involves {ATP-based} excision to unblock chain-terminated primers and allow {HIV} replication to continue. There is an urgent need for new drugs and for new therapies that can overcome the excision mechanism of resistance. Compounds that disrupt the binding of the excision reaction substrate(s) (the blocked primer and/or {ATP} and/or pyrophosphate), or mimic the dinucleoside tetraphosphate product of the {ATP-based} excision reaction are potential inhibitors of excision. Detailed understanding of drug resistance mechanisms can reveal novel targets for anti-viral agents.},

	abstract = {Limited searching in the conformational space is one of the major obstacles for investigating protein dynamics by numerical approaches. For this reason, classical all-atom molecular dynamics {(MD)} simulations of proteins tend to be confined to local energy minima, particularly when the bulk solvent is treated explicitly. To overcome this problem, we have developed a novel replica exchange protocol that uses modified force-field parameters to treat interparticle nonbonded potentials within the protein and between protein and solvent atoms, leaving unperturbed those relative to solventsolvent interactions. We have tested the new protocol on the 18-residue-long tip of the P domain of calreticulin in an explicit solvent. With only eight replicas, we have been able to considerably enhance the conformational space sampled during a 100 ns simulation, compared to as many parallel classical molecular dynamics simulations of the same length or to a single one lasting 450 ns. A direct comparison between the various simulations has been possible thanks to the implementation of the weighted histogram analysis method, by which conformations simulated with modified force-field parameters can be assigned different weights. Interatom, inter-residue distances in the structural ensembles obtained with our novel replica exchange approach and by classical {MD} simulations compare equally well with those derived from {NMR} data. Rare events, such as unfolding and refolding, occur with reasonable statistical frequency. Visiting of conformations characterized by very small Boltzmann weights is also possible. Despite their low probability, such regions of the conformational space may play an important role in the search for local potential-energy minima and in dynamically controlled functions.},

In many instances it is, however, desirable to describe key portions of a molecular system at the atomic level. There is therefore a strong interest in the development of simulation methodologies that allow representations of matter with mixed granularities in a multiscale fashion. We report here a strategy to conduct mixed atomic-level and coarse-grain simulations of molecular systems with a recently developed coarse-grain model. The methodology is validated by computing partition coefficients of small molecules described in atomic detail and solvated by water or octane, both of which are represented by coarse-grain models. Because the present coarse-grain force field retains electrostatic interactions, the simplified solvent particles can interact realistically with the all-atom solutes. The partition coefficients computed by this approach rival the accuracy of fully atomistic simulations and are obtained at a fraction of their computational cost. The present methodology is simple, robust and applicable to a wide variety of molecular systems.},

The study is limited to a single state point and system size. In accord with recent arguments made in the context of the hard-sphere model, we find that any single- or multi-stage approach that incorporates a 'deletion' component shows greatly diminished accuracy and precision when compared to its 'insertion' counterpart. We also confirm our earlier conjecture that the entropy rather than the free energy is the important quantity to examine when formulating optimal multistage free-energy perturbation schemes. {(C)} 1998 Elsevier Science {B.V.} All rights reserved.},

The method can be used for the creation of de novo ligands and for the modification of existing ligands. The binding site is saturated with atoms (sp(3) carbon atoms in the present implementation) that form molecules under the influence of a potential function that joins atoms to each other with the correct stereochemistry. The resulting molecules are linked to precomputed functional gro up minimum energy positions in the binding site, The generalized potential function allows atoms to sample a continuous parameter space that includes the Cartesian coordinates and their occupancy and type, e.g., the method allows change of an sp(3) carbon into an sp(2) carbon or oxygen, A parameter space formulated in this way can then be sampled and optimized by a variety of methods. In this work, molecules are generated by use of a Monte Carlo simulated annealing algorithm, The {DLD} method is illustrated by its application to the binding site of {FK506} binding protein {(FKBP),} an immunophilin. De novo ligands are designed and modification of the immunosuppressant drug {FK506} are suggested, The results demonstrate that the dynamic ligand design approach can automatically construct ligands which complement both the shape and charge distribution of the binding site. {(C)} 1995 {Wiley-Liss,} Inc.},

Input to the model is the distribution of work values underlying the {NEW} calculation, and the bias is estimated by assuming that all of the inaccuracy is incurred by failure to sample work values beyond a specific point in the tail of the distribution. The model is formulated considering both small- and large-sample {NEW} calculations. It is then applied to the study of bias for cases in which the work distribution is Gaussian. The model is shown to give an excellent description of the bias in situations where the bias is a more significant source of error than the sample variance. A scaling law is presented and it is shown that the bias as a function of sampling can be reduced to a single universal curve, approximately valid for all Gaussian work distributions. This result is used to formulate a simple criterion that can be applied to test if a {NEW} calculation is effectively free of bias. The criterion is shown to be effective even though it uses the measured (and perhaps biased) free energy as an input.},

It is shown that even though distamycin is less hydrated than netropsin, the loss of ligand–solvent interactions is very similar for both ligands. The relat- ive mobilities of the ligands in their bound and free forms indicate a larger entropic penalty for distamycin when binding to the minor groove compared with net- ropsin, partially explaining the lower binding affinity of the distamycin molecule.

As an application, we perform the binding affinity calculations of six theophylline-related ligands with {RNA} aptamer. Basically, our method is applicable when using many compute nodes to accelerate simulations, thus a parallel computing system is also developed. To further reduce the computational cost, the adequate non-uniform intervals of coupling constant [lambda], connecting two equilibrium states, namely bound and unbound, are determined. The absolute binding energies {[Delta]G} thus obtained have effective linear relation between the computed and experimental values. If the results of two other different methods are compared, thermodynamic integration {(TI)} and molecular mechanics {Poisson-Boltzmann} surface area {(MM-PBSA)} by the paper of Gouda et al. {[H.} Gouda, {I.D.} Kuntz, {D.A.} Case, {P.A.} Kollman, Biopolymers 68 (2003) 16], the predictive accuracy of the relative values {[Delta][Delta]G} is almost comparable to that of {TI:} the correlation coefficients {(R)} obtained are 0.99 (this work), 0.97 {(TI),} and 0.78 {(MM-PBSA).} On absolute binding energies meanwhile, a constant energy shift of -7 kcal/mol against the experimental values is evident. To solve this problem, several presumable reasons are investigated.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Water molecules play a crucial role in mediating the interaction between a ligand and a macromolecular receptor. An understanding of the nature and role of each water molecule in the active site of a protein could greatly increase the efficiency of rational drug design approaches: if the propensity of a water molecule for displacement can be determined, then synthetic effort may be most profitably applied to the design of specific ligands with the displacement of this water molecule in mind. In this paper, a thermodynamic analysis of water molecules in the binding sites of six proteins, each complexed with a number of inhibitors, is presented. Two classes of water molecules were identified: those conserved and not displaced by any of the ligands, and those that are displaced by some ligands. The absolute binding free energies of 54 water molecules were calculated using the double decoupling method, with replica exchange thermodynamic integration in Monte Carlo simulations. It was found that conserved water molecules are on average more tightly bound than displaced water molecules. In addition, Bayesian statistics is used to calculate the probability that a particular water molecule may be displaced by an appropriately designed ligand, given the calculated binding free energy of the water molecule. This approach therefore allows the numerical assessment of whether or not a given water molecule should be targeted for displacement as part of a rational drug design strategy.},

	abstract = {We have examined some subtle parameter modifications to the Cornell et al. force field, which has proven quite successful in reproducing nucleic acid properties, but whose C2'-endo sugar pucker phase and helical repeat for B {DNA} appear to be somewhat underestimated. Encouragingly, the addition of a single V-2 term involving the atoms {C(sp(3))-O-(sp(3))-C(sp(3))-N(sp(2)),} which can be nicely rationalized because of the anomeric effect (lone pairs on oxygen are preferentially oriented relative to the electron withdrawing N), brings the sugar pucker phase of C2'-endo sugars to near perfect agreement with ab initio calculations {(W} near 162 degrees). Secondly, the use of high level ab initio calculations on entire nucleosides (in contrast to smaller model systems necessitated in 1994-95 by computer limitations) lets one improve the chi torsional potential for nucleic acids. Finally, the {O(sp(3))-C(sp(3))-C(sp(3))-O(sp(3))} V-2 torsional potential has been empirically adjusted to reproduce the ab initio calculated relative energy of C2'-endo and C3'-endo nucleosides. These modifications are tested in molecular dynamics simulations of mononucleosides (to assess sugar pucker percentages) and double helices of {DNA} and {RNA} (to assess helical and sequence specific structural properties). In both areas, the modified force field leads to improved agreement with experimental data.},

These macroscopic modeling tasks, yielding information over long time and large space scales, are accomplished through appropriately initialized calls to the microscopic simulator for only short times and small spatial domains. Our equation-free {(EF)} approach, when successful, can bypass the derivation of the macroscopic evolution equations when these equations conceptually exist but are not available in closed form. We discuss how the mathematics-assisted development of a computational superstructure may enable alternative descriptions of the problem physics (e.g. Lattice Boltzmann {(LB),} kinetic Monte Carlo {(KMC)} or Molecular Dynamics {(MD)} microscopic simulators, executed over relatively short time and space scales) to perform systems level tasks (integration over relatively large time and space scales,“coarse” bifurcation analysis, optimization, and control) directly. In effect, the procedure constitutes a systems identification based, “closure on demand” computational toolkit, bridging microscopic/stochastic simulation with traditional continuum scientific computation and numerical analysis. We illustrate these ideas through examples from chemical kinetics {(LB,} {KMC),} rheology {(Brownian} Dynamics), homogenization and the computation of “coarsely self-similar” solutions, and discuss various features, limitations and potential extensions of the approach.},

thermodynamics of surface interactions, has been used in its {COSMOtherm} implementation for the direct, blind prediction of
tautomeric equilibria within the {SAMPL2} challenge. Since the quantum chemical level underlying {COSMOtherm,} i.e. {BP/TZVP} {DFT-calculations,}
is known to be of limited accuracy with respect to reaction energies, we tested {MP2} reaction energy corrections in addition.
As expected, the straight application of the latest version of {COSMOtherm} yielded a poor predictive accuracy of {\textasciitilde}4 kcal/mol
{(RMSE)} for the eight compounds of the blind prediction data set, and the {MP2-corrected} predictions reduced the average error
considerably to {\textasciitilde}1.2 kcal/mol. But a more detailed analysis shows that this improvement is not systematic and mostly a lucky
coincidence on the small data set. The systematic results of {COSMOtherm} allow for an efficient empirical correction with an
{RMSE} of 0.61 kcal/mol. This allows for systematic predictions for the most important case of generalized keto-enol tautomerism.},

	abstract = {A three-dimensional model structure of a complex formed by a G-protein-coupled receptor {(GPCR)} and an agonist ligand is probed and refined using molecular-dynamics simulations and free energy calculations in a realistic environment. The model of the human receptor of cholecystokinin associated to agonist ligand {CCK9} was obtained from a synergistic procedure combining site-directed mutagenesis experiments and in silico modeling. The 31-ns molecular-dynamics simulation in an explicit membrane environment indicates that both the structure of the receptor and its interactions with the ligand are robust. Whereas the secondary structure of the alpha-helix bundle is well preserved, the region of the intracellular loops exhibits a significant flexibility likely to be ascribed to the absence of G-protein subunits in the model. New insight into the structural features of the binding pocket is gained, in particular, the interplay of the ligand with both the receptor and internal water molecules. Water-mediated interactions are shown to participate in the binding, hence, suggesting additional site-directed mutagenesis experiments. Accurate free energy calculations on mutated ligands provide differences in the receptor-ligand binding affinity, thus offering a direct, quantitative comparison to experiment. We propose that this detailed consistency-checking procedure be used as a routine refinement step of in vacuo {GPCR} models, before further investigation and application to structure-based drug design.},

	abstract = {The innate immune system guards against virus infection through a variety of mechanisms including mobilization of the host interferon system, which attacks viral products mainly at a posttranscriptional level. The influenza virus {NS1} protein is a multifunctional facilitator of virus replication, one of whose actions is to antagonize the interferon response. Since {NS1} is required for efficient virus replication, it was reasoned that chemical inhibitors of this protein could be used to further understand virus-host interactions and also serve as potential new antiviral agents. A yeast-based assay was developed to identify compounds that phenotypically suppress {NS1} function. Several such compounds exhibited significant activity specifically against influenza A virus in cell culture but had no effect on the replication of another {RNA} virus, respiratory syncytial virus. Interestingly, cells lacking an interferon response were drug resistant, suggesting that the compounds block interactions between {NS1} and the interferon system. Accordingly, the compounds reversed the inhibition of beta interferon {mRNA} induction during infection, which is known to be caused by {NS1.} In addition, the compounds blocked the ability of {NS1} protein to inhibit double-stranded {RNA-dependent} activation of a transfected beta interferon promoter construct. The effects of the compounds were specific to {NS1,} because they had no effect on the ability of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus papainlike protease protein to block beta interferon promoter activation. These data demonstrate that the function of {NS1} can be modulated by chemical inhibitors and that such inhibitors will be useful as probes of biological function and as starting points for clinical drug development.},

We find, first, good general agreement between the simulations and the experiments, with an rms error of 1.24 kcal/mol over the whole set (i.e., about 2 {kT)} and a correlation coefficient of 0.89. Second, we use an automated procedure to identify systematic errors for some classes of compounds and suggest some improvements to the force field. We find that alkyne hydration free energies are particularly poorly predicted due to problems with a {Lennard-Jones} well depth and find that an alternate choice for this well depth largely rectifies the situation. Third, we study the nonpolar component of hydration free energiesthat is, the part that is not due to electrostatics. While we find that repulsive and attractive components of the nonpolar part both scale roughly with surface area (or volume) of the solute, the total nonpolar free energy does not scale with the solute surface area or volume, because it is a small difference between large components and is dominated by the deviations from the trend. While the methods used here are not new, this is a more extensive test than previous explicit solvent studies, and the size of the test set allows identification of systematic problems with force field parameters for particular classes of compounds. We believe that the computed free energies and components will be valuable to others in the future development of force fields and solvation models.},

	abstract = {Polarization cost is the energy needed to distort the wave function of a molecule from one appropriate to the gas phase to one appropriate for some condensed phase. Although it is not currently standard practice, polarization cost should be considered when deriving improved fixed charge force fields based on fits to certain types of experimental data and when using such force fields to compute observables that involve changes in molecular polarization. Building on earlier work, we present mathematical expressions and a method to estimate the effect of polarization cost on free energy and enthalpy implied by a charge model meant to represent a solvated state. The charge model can be any combination of point charges, higher-order multipoles, or even distributed charge densities, as long as they do not change in response to environment. The method is illustrated by computing the effect of polarization cost on free energies of hydration for the neutral amino acid side chain analogues as predicted using two popular fixed charge force fields and one based on electron densities computed using quantum chemistry techniques that employ an implicit model to represent aqueous solvent. From comparison of the computed and experimental hydration free energies, we find that two commonly used force fields are too underpolarized in their description of the solute−water interaction. On the other hand, a charge model based on the charge density from a hybrid density functional calculation that used an implicit model for aqueous solvent performs well for hydration free energies of these molecules after the correction for dipole polarization is applied. As such, an improved description of the density (e.g., {B3LYP,} {MP2)} in conjunction with an implicit solvent (e.g., {PCM)} or explicit solvent (e.g., {QM/MM)} approach may offer promise as a starting point for the development of improved fixed charge models for force fields.},

New proteins emerge from the ribosome through an exit tunnel as nascent polypeptide chains. Recent findings indicate that tunnel interactions with the nascent polypeptide chain might be relevant for the regulation of translation. However, the specific ribosomal structural features that mediate this process are unknown. Performing molecular dynamics simulations, we are studying the interactions between components of the ribosome exit tunnel and different chemical probes (specifically different amino acid side chains or monovalent inorganic ions). Our free-energy maps describe the physicochemical environment of the tunnel, revealing binding crevices and free-energy barriers for single amino acids and ions. Our simulations indicate that transport out of the tunnel could be different for diverse amino acid species. In addition, our results predict a notable {protein–RNA} interaction between a flexible {23S} {rRNA} tetraloop (gate) and ribosomal protein L39 (latch) that could potentially obstruct the tunnel's exit. By relating our simulation data to earlier biochemical studies, we propose that ribosomal features at the exit of the tunnel can play a role in the regulation of nascent chain exit and ion flux. Moreover, our free-energy maps may provide a context for interpreting sequence-dependent nascent chain phenomenology.},

	abstract = {The complexes of phage T4 lysozyme {L99A} with noble gases have been studied by molecular dynamics simulation. In a long simulation of the complex with one Xe atom, the structure was found to undergo global conformation change involving a reversible opening and closing of the entrance to the substrate-binding site, during which the conformations of the N and C-terminal domains varied little. The distributions of Xe positions sampled in dynamics simulations were refined in terms of anisotropic Gaussian distributions via least-squares minimization of the difference between Fourier transforms. In addition, molecular transformation simulations have been applied in order to calculate the binding free energies of Xe, Kr and Ar relative to a standard state at a pressure of 1 bar. A single bound Xe is found to assume an equilibrium distribution over three adjacent preferred sites, while in a {two-Xe} complex, the two Xe atoms preferentially occupy two of these. The positions of the three sites agree closely with the positions of bound Xe determined in the refined crystal structure of a complex formed at a pressure of 8 bar Xe, and the calculated affinities agree well with the observed partial occupancies. At a pressure of 8 bar, a mixture of {one-Xe} and {two-Xe} complexes is present, and similarly for complexes with Kr and Ar, with single occupancy relatively more prevalent with Kr and Ar. {(Binding} of a third Xe atom is found to be quite unfavorable.) A comparison with simulation results for the binding of benzene to the same site leads to the conclusion that binding of Xe within cavities in proteins is common because of several favorable factors: (1) Xe has a large atomic polarizability; (2) Xe can be applied at a relatively high pressure, i.e. high chemical potential; (3) an unfavorable entropic term related to the need to orient the ligand in the binding site is absent. Finally, it is found that the model's binding energy of a water molecule in the cavity is insufficient to overcome the unfavorable binding entropy.},

These interactions describe the energetics of all possible configurations of the same alloy, which can hence be readily used to identify ground state structures and, through statistical mechanics solutions, find finite-temperature properties. In practice, the biggest challenge is to identify the types of interactions which are most important for a given alloy out of the many possibilities. We describe a genetic algorithm which automates this task. To avoid a possible trapping in a locally optimal interaction set, we periodically “lock out” persistent near-optimal cluster expansions. In this way, we identify not only the best possible combination of interaction types but also any near-optimal cluster expansions. Our strategy is not restricted to the cluster expansion method alone, and can be applied to select the qualitative parameter types of any other class of complex model Hamiltonians.},

It introduces a bias factor in Monte Carlo simulations or, equivalently, a bias force in molecular dynamics simulations. The bias factor targets the energy gap, i.e., the difference in energy function between two states, and is therefore specifically designed for calculating free-energy differences. The goal is to make the probability density of the energy gap as uniform as possible, thus allowing for its accurate determination. An iterative procedure, based on simulations at higher temperatures, is devised to obtain the bias factor. The same method naturally extends to the calculation of potentials of mean force. The generalized coordinate, for which the potential of mean force is to be calculated, now plays the role of the energy gap. Applications to model systems confirm the expected increase in accuracy of calculated free-energy differences and potentials of mean force.},

The activation step that prepares the surface of the pores of the dextran polymer layer for the immobilization of the charged ligands insignificantly affected the pore structure of the dextran polymer layer, while this was found to not be the case for previously studied systems that involved high dextran polymer surface densities. Compared to the high dextran polymer density system studied previously, the intermediate dextran polymer density system can generate significantly larger pores but still possesses relatively high interconnection and mutual steric support between dextran chains to exhibit similar structural characteristics and responses to charged ligand immobilization, including dextran layer thickness, stability, monomer distribution, ligand-induced compact chain structures, dextran layer shrinkage, distributions of ligands and counterions, and local nonelectroneutrality. The low dextran polymer density system having relatively isolated dextran chains and insufficient mutual steric support can result in even larger pores than those obtained in the intermediate dextran polymer density system, but a significantly thinner porous dextran polymer layer and different dextran monomer distributions are obtained in the low dextran polymer density system. More importantly, the gradient of the local nonelectroneutrality after the immobilization of the charged ligands is significantly smaller in magnitude in the low dextran polymer density system than that obtained in the system having intermediate dextran polymer density, and, despite a lack of porous layer depth to accommodate adsorbate biomolecules in large amounts, it could still be useful for the effective transport and adsorption of very large biomolecules. Compared with the polymeric monoliths without a porous dextran polymer layer grafted on the surface of their throughpores, the intermediate and low dextran polymer density systems explored and studied in this work provide pore structures with desirable characteristics for the effective transport of adsorbate biomolecules and substantially larger effective surface areas and throughput capacities for the adsorption of the adsorbate biomolecules.},

	volume = {122},
	abstract = {Monte Carlo {(MC)} statistical mechanics simulations have been carried out for more than 200 organic solutes, including 125 drugs and related heterocycles, in aqueous solution. The calculations were highly automated and used the {OPLS-AA} force field augmented with {CM1P} partial charges. Configurationally averaged results were obtained for a variety of physically significant quantities including the solute-water Coulomb and {Lennard-Jones} interaction energies, solvent-accessible surface area {(SASA),} and numbers of donor and acceptor hydrogen bonds. Correlations were then obtained between these descriptors and gas to liquid free energies of solvation in hexadecane, octanol, and water and octanol/water partition coefficients. Linear regressions with three or four descriptors yielded fits with correlation coefficients, r(2), of 0.9 in all cases. The regression equation for log P(octanol/water) only needs four descriptors to provide an rms error of 0.55 for 200 diverse compounds, which is competitive with the best fragment methods. For water, the expanded data set of 85 solutes and improved statistical analyses bring into question the significance of the {Lennard-Jones} and surface area terms that have been featured in prior linear-response treatments. The results are sensitive to the choice of partial charges for the solute atoms; poor representation of some functional groups can lead to the need for specific corrections in the regression equations. This is expected to also be true for force-field-based scoring functions for protein-ligand binding. In all cases, the present descriptors that emerge as most significant sensibly reveal the key physical factors that control solvation, especially solute size in organic solvents and electrostatic interactions in water. Furthermore, additional {MC} simulations for solutes in both water and ethanol clearly demonstrate that the key differential between water and alcohols is the greater hydrogren-bond-donating ability of water, which explains the significance of a solute's hydrogen-bond-accepting; ability for log P(octanol/water).},

	abstract = {Summary Diffusion of small nonelectrolytes through planar lipid bilayer membranes (egg phosphatidylcholine-decane) was examined by correlating the permeability coefficients of 22 solutes with their partition coefficients between water and four organic solvents. High correlations were observed with hexadecane and olive oil (r=0.95 and 0.93), but not octanol and ether (r=0.75 and 0.74). Permeabilities of the seven smallest molecules (mol wt {\textless}50) (water, hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid, ammonia, methylamine, formic acid and formamide) were 2- to 15-fold higher than the values predicted by the permeabilities of the larger molecules (50{\textless}300). The “extra” permeabilities of the seven smallest molecules were not correlated with partition coefficients but were inversely correlated with molecular volumes. The larger solute permeabilities also decreased with increasing molecular volume, but the relationship was neither steep nor significant. The permeability pattern cannot be explained by the molecular volume dependence of partitioning into the bilayer or by the existence of transient aqueous pores. The molecular volume dependence of solute permeability suggests that the membrane barrier behaves more like a polymer than a liquid hydrocarbon. All the data are consistent with the “solubility-diffusion” model, which can explain both the hydrophobicity dependence and the molecular volume dependence of nonelectrolyte permeability.},

model and the self consistent reaction field {IEF-PCM} to standard non-polarizable charge models such as {RESP} and {AM1-BCC.} We
also determine an optimal restraint weight for {Dielectric-RESP} atomic charges fitting. Statistical analysis of the results
could not distinguish the methods from one another. The smallest average unsigned error obtained is 1.9 ± 0.6 kcal/mol (95\%
confidence level). A class of outliers led us to investigate the importance of the solute–solvent instantaneous induction
energy, a missing term in {PB} continuum models. We estimated values between −1.5 and −6 kcal/mol for a series of halo-benzenes

	abstract = {Chemical space whether defined by small molecules or large proteins is larger than can be usefully explored. One of the challenges of drug discovery is thus the definition of the overlap between chemical space, biologically useful space and pharmacological space and how this may be employed in the discovery of new small molecule drugs. Despite the decrease in drug discovery productivity in recent years there is no shortage of targets for small molecule intervention, including stroke, pain, neurodegenerative diseases, inflammation and bacterial and viral infections.
Only an extremely small fraction of available chemical space has thus far been explored and it is likely that prior synthetic constraints and bias to existing frameworks and scaffolds have contributed to this. Several approaches are being employed to explore more fruitful paths to discovery. These include recognition that existing therapeutic entities already occupy validated pharmacological space and thus are good leads, the use of molecular fragments that permits a broader exploration of chemical space, and the role of templates that permit fragments to combine to generate active species. Finally, a new focus on natural product-like scaffolds from both synthetic methodologies and the genetic reengineering of biosynthetic pathways is likely to prove valuable.
However the exploration of chemical space will alone not solve the current deficit in drug discovery productivity. It is necessary to recognize that cellular environments are not the dilute homogeneous solutions of many screening systems and that a more integrated systems approach will serve to maximize any success of chemical space exploration.},

Furthermore, the models correctly identify the bound conformations of some ligands. We used unliganded {HIV-1} protease to develop and validate this method. Drug design is always initiated with a protein-ligand structure, and such success with unbound protein structures is remarkable - particularly in the case of {HIV-1} protease, which has a large conformational change upon binding. This technique holds the promise of successful computer-based drug design before bound crystal structures are even discovered, which can mean a jump-start of 1-3 years in tackling some medically relevant systems with computational methods.},

Here we apply alchemical free energy calculations in explicit solvent to predict ligand binding in a model cavity in T4 lysozyme. Even in this simple site, there are challenges. We made systematic improvements, beginning with single poses from docking, then including multiple poses, additional protein conformational changes, and using an improved charge model. Computed absolute binding free energies had an {RMS} error of 1.9 kcal/mol relative to previously determined. experimental values. In blind prospective tests, the methods correctly discriminated between several true ligands and decoys in a set of putative binders identified by docking. In these prospective tests, the {RMS} error in predicted binding free energies relative to those subsequently determined experimentally was only 0.6 kcal/mol. X-ray crystal structures of the new ligands bound in the cavity corresponded closely to predictions from the free energy calculations, but sometimes differed from those predicted by docking. Finally, we examined the impact of holding the protein rigid, as in docking, with a view to learning how approximations made in docking affect accuracy and how they may be improved.

We have simulated a total of nearly 38 mus of, folding time and obtained eight complete and independent folding trajectories. Starting from an extended state, we observe relaxation to an unfolded state characterized by non-specific, temporary hydrogen bonding. This is followed by the appearance of interactions between hydrophobic residues that stabilize a bent intermediate. Final formation of the complete hydrophobic core occurs cooperatively at the same time that the final hydrogen bonding pattern appears. The folded hairpin structures we observe all contain a closely packed hydrophobic core and proper beta -sheet backbone dihedral angles, but they differ in backbone hydrogen bonding pattern. We show that this is consistent with the existing experimental data on the hairpin alone in solution. Our analysis also reveals short-lived semi-helical intermediates which define a thermodynamic trap. Our results are consistent with a three-state mechanism with a single rate-limiting step in which a varying final hydrogen bond pattern is apparent, and senmi-helical off-pathway intermediates may appear early in the folding process. We include details of the ensemble dynamics methodology and a discussion of our achievements using this new computational device for studying dynamics at the atomic level.},

	volume = {107},
	abstract = {ntropy and enthalpy compensation are frequently observed in thermodynamic measurements. To understand the molecular details of these compensating changes, molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo methods may, in principle, be used. Yet, in practice, computational methods to evaluate changes in entropy and enthalpy usually have much greater (e.g. order of magnitude worse) error than relative free energy calculations. In this paper, we examine ways to improve the computational ability to determine changes in both enthalpy and entropy. Toward that end we consider five different perturbation schemes for enthalpy determination and also consider the relative importance of staging the computation (i.e., dividing the entire perturbation calculation into a series of consecutive smaller ones) along the reaction coordinate. Two model systems are used for evaluation: a system of {Lennard-Jones} spheres, where the computation is directed to the addition/deletion of a sphere, and the alchemical transformation of an anion in explicit {TIP3P} water from one type to another. The results show only subtle differences among the better perturbation methods and much larger improvement in relative accuracy with the use and careful selection of staged intermediates along the reaction coordinate. As a result of these calculations, we suggest that approximate calculations of relative entropy be used to guide the staging of intermediates for computation of free energy, entropy, and enthalpy differences. We suggest that for these purposes the single state perturbation {(SSP)} method is the best choice. For the pure purpose of enthalpy and/or entropy evaluation, we suggest multistage {SSP} and direct approach, respectively, for systems with small and large differences.},

	abstract = {Here we present a program aimed at free-energy calculations in molecular systems. It consists of a series of routines that can be interfaced with the most popular classical molecular dynamics {(MD)} codes through a simple patching procedure. This leaves the possibility for the user to exploit many different {MD} engines depending on the system simulated and on the computational resources available. Free-energy calculations can be performed as a function of many collective variables, with a particular focus on biological problems, and using state-of-the-art methods such as metadynamics, umbrella sampling and Jarzynski-equation based steered {MD.} The present software, written in {ANSI-C} language, can be easily interfaced with both Fortran and {C/C++} {codes.Program} summary

The {ABMD} method belongs to the general category of umbrella sampling methods with an evolving biasing potential and is inspired by the metadynamics method. The {ABMD} method has several useful features, including a small number of control parameters and an O(t) numerical cost with molecular dynamics time t. The {ABMD} method naturally allows for extensions based on multiple walkers and replica exchange, where different replicas can have different temperatures and/or collective variables. This is beneficial not only in terms of the speed and accuracy of a calculation, but also in terms of the amount of useful information that may be obtained from a given simulation. The workings of the {ABMD} method are illustrated via a study of the folding of the {Ace-GGPGGG-Nme} peptide in a gaseous and solvated environment.},

To further exploit the accuracy of the free-energy predictions for this system, the faster free-energy algorithm {MINTA} was used as a prediction tool to test the binding affinity of the macrocycle towards a series of several other amino acid derivatives, which speeded up considerably the screening process and reduced laboratory costs.},

Both the structure and dynamics of the liquid water model were affected by the methods used to truncate the long-range interactions. For some of the methods artificial structuring of the model liquid was observed around the cutoff radius. The model liquid properties were also affected by the commonly applied temperature control methods. Four different methods for controlling the temperature of the system were studied. and the effects of these methods on the bulk properties for liquid water were analyzed. The system size was also found to change the dynamics of the model liquid water, Two control simulations with the {SPC/E} water model were carried out. The self-diffusion coefficient {(D),} the radial distribution function (g(oo)), the distance dependent Kirkwood G-factor {[G(k)(r)]} and the intermolecular potential energy {(E-pot)} were determined from the different trajectories and compared with the experimental data.},

The over all results of the correlation between the predicted and experimental partition coefficients demonstrate that {COSMO-RS} is able to a priori predict the values of all systems under investigation for almost all organic compounds. As a showcase, the outliers of the hexadecane-water system were critically assessed. In two cases the prediction could be improved by correcting the underlying chemical structure. The remaining three outliers are due to known problems of seldom elements (germanium compounds) or of insufficient conformational representation of the molecule (crown-ethers). Finally, {DeltalogP} which is the difference between {(logPow-logPalk)} is correlated with the blood-brain partition coefficient {(logBB).} On an external test set of 199 compounds the {logBB} prediction based on {DeltalogP} is slightly inferior to our existing {QSPR} model {(RMSE:} 0.52 vs. 0.46)},

At its introduction in 1981, the {QH} method was successfully applied to simple molecular systems with only one highly occupied energy well, and fluctuations were analyzed in a system of internal bond-angle-torsion coordinates. However, more recent studies have applied the {QH} method to complex biomolecular systems and have relied upon Cartesian coordinates. The present study evaluates the accuracy of the {QH} method through comparisons with more detailed methods. The chief findings are that the {QH} method can markedly overestimate the configurational entropy for systems with multiple occupied energy wells and that such errors tend to be magnified by the use of Cartesian coordinates instead of bond-angle-torsion coordinates.},

For this, all torsions have been refitted for a nonbonded 1−4 scale factor of 0.5, which is the standard in {OPLS-AA.} Improved van der Waals parameters have been obtained for the acyl lipid tails by matching simulation results of bulk pentadecane against recently improved experimental measurements. The charge set has been adjusted from previous lipid force fields to allow for an identical treatment of the alkoxy ester groups. This reduces the amount of parameters required for the model. Simulation of {DPPC} bilayers in the tension-free {NPT} ensemble at 50 {°C} gives the correct area per lipid of 62.9 ± 0.1 Å2, which compares well with the recently refined experimental value of 63.0 Å2. Electron density profiles and deuterium order parameters are similarly well reproduced. The new parameters will allow for improved simulation results in microsecond scale peptide partitioning simulations, which have proved problematic with prior parametrizations.},

Motivated by the current {CHARMM} lipid {FF} {(C27} and C27r) systematically yielding values of the surface area per lipid that are smaller than experimental estimates and gel-like structures of bilayers well above the gel transition temperature, selected torsional, {Lennard-Jones} and partial atomic charge parameters were modified by targeting both quantum mechanical {(QM)} and experimental data. {QM} calculations ranging from high-level ab initio calculations on small molecules to semiempirical {QM} studies on a 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine {(DPPC)} bilayer in combination with experimental thermodynamic data were used as target data for parameter optimization. These changes were tested with simulations of pure bilayers at high hydration of the following six lipids: {DPPC,} 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine {(DMPC),} 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine {(DLPC),} 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine {(POPC),} 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine {(DOPC),} and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylethanolamine {(POPE);} simulations of a low hydration {DOPC} bilayer were also performed. Agreement with experimental surface area is on average within 2\%, and the density profiles agree well with neutron and X-ray diffraction experiments. {NMR} deuterium order parameters {(SCD)} are well predicted with the new {FF,} including proper splitting of the {SCD} for the aliphatic carbon adjacent to the carbonyl for {DPPC,} {POPE,} and {POPC} bilayers. The area compressibility modulus and frequency dependence of {13C} {NMR} relaxation rates of {DPPC} and the water distribution of low hydration {DOPC} bilayers also agree well with experiment. Accordingly, the presented lipid {FF,} referred to as C36, allows for molecular dynamics simulations to be run in the tensionless ensemble {(NPT),} and is anticipated to be of utility for simulations of pure lipid systems as well as heterogeneous systems including membrane proteins.},

	abstract = {To reach their biological target, drugs have to cross cell membranes, and understanding passive membrane permeation is therefore crucial for rational drug design. Molecular dynamics simulations offer a powerful way of studying permeation at the single molecule level. Starting from a computer model proven to be able to reproduce the physical properties of a biological membrane, the behaviour of small solutes and large drugs in a lipid bilayer has been studied. Analysis of dihedral angles shows that a few nanosesconds are sufficient for the simulations to converge towards common values for those angles, even if the starting structures belong to different conformations. Results clearly show that, despite their difference in size, small solutes and large drugs tend to lie parallel to the bilayer normal and that, when moving from water solution into biomembranes, permeants lose degrees of freedom. This explains the experimental observation that partitioning and permeation are highly affected by entropic effects and are size-dependent. Tilted orientations, however, occur when they make possible the formation of hydrogen bonds. This helps to understand the reason why hydrogen bonding possibilities are an important parameter in cruder approaches which predict drug absorption after administration. Interestingly, hydration is found to occur even in the membrane core, which is usually considered an almost hydrophobic region. Simulations suggest the possibility for highly polar compounds like acetic acid to cross biological membranes while hydrated. These simulations prove useful for drug design in rationalising experimental observations and predicting solute behaviour in biomembranes.},

	abstract = {The binding of a series of p-alkylbenzamidinium chloride inhibitors to the serine proteinase trypsin over a range of temperatures has been studied using isothermal titration (micro)calorimetry and molecular dynamics simulation techniques. The inhibitors have small structural variations at the para position of the benzamidinium ion. They show small differences in relative binding affinity but large compensating differences in enthalpy and entropy. Binding affinity decreases with increased branching at the first carbon but increases with increasing the length of a linear alkyl substituent, suggesting that steric hindrance and hydrophobic interactions play dominant roles in binding. Structural analysis showed that the backbone of the enzyme was unaffected by the change of the para substituent. In addition, binding does not correlate strongly with octanol/water partition data. To further characterize this system, the change in the heat capacity on binding, the change in solvent-accessible surface area on binding, the effect of inhibitor binding on the hydration of the active site, the {pK(a)} of His57, and interactions within the catalytic triad have been investigated. Although the changes in inhibitor structure are small, it is demonstrated that simple concepts such as steric hindrance, hydrophobicity, and buried surface area are insufficient to explain the binding data. Other factors, such as access to the binding site and the cost of dehydration of the active site, are of equal or greater importance.},

However, many effective drugs act via modulation of multiple proteins rather than single targets. Advances in systems biology are revealing a phenotypic robustness and a network structure that strongly suggests that exquisitely selective compounds, compared with multitarget drugs, may exhibit lower than desired clinical efficacy. This new appreciation of the role of polypharmacology has significant implications for tackling the two major sources of attrition in drug development - efficacy and toxicity. Integrating network biology and polypharmacology holds the promise of expanding the current opportunity space for druggable targets. However, the rational design of polypharmacology faces considerable challenges in the need for new methods to validate target combinations and optimize multiple structure-activity relationships while maintaining drug-like properties. Advances in these areas are creating the foundation of the next paradigm in drug discovery: network pharmacology.},

Reference rates for alanine-containing peptides were determined and effects of temperature considered. These results provide the information necessary to evaluate measured protein {NH} to {ND} exchange rates by comparing them with rates to be expected for the same amino acid sequence is unstructured aligo- and polypeptides.

Prioritization rules ensure that less characteristic, peripheral rings are removed first. All scaffolds in the hierarchy tree are well-defined chemical entities making the classification chemically intuitive. The classification is deterministic, data-set-independent, and scales linearly with the number of compounds included in the data set. The application of the classification is demonstrated on two data sets extracted from the {PubChem} database, namely, pyruvate kinase binders and a collection of pesticides. The examples shown demonstrate that the classification procedure handles robustly synthetic structures and natural products.},

By comparing these results and the available crystal structure data and/or higher level density functional theory results, it was concluded that the newer parameterizations for force fields {(GROMOS,} {GLYCAM06,} {OPLS-2005} and {CSFF)} give results that are reasonably similar to each other, whereas the older parameterizations for Amber, charmm or {OPLS} were more divergent.

	abstract = {A method is presented for extracting the configurational entropy of solute molecules from molecular dynamics simulations, in which the entropy is computed as an expansion of multidimensional mutual information terms, which account for correlated motions among the various internal degrees of freedom of the molecule. The mutual information expansion is demonstrated to be equivalent to estimating the full-dimensional configurational probability density function {(PDF)} using the generalized Kirkwood superposition approximation {(GKSA).} While the mutual information expansion is derived to the full dimensionality of the molecule, the current application uses a truncated form of the expansion in which all fourth- and higher-order mutual information terms are neglected. Truncation of the mutual information expansion at the nth order is shown to be equivalent to approximating the full-dimensional {PDF} using joint {PDFs} with dimensionality of n or smaller by successive application of the {GKSA.} The expansion method is used to compute the absolute (classical) configurational entropy in a basis of bond-angle-torsion internal coordinates for several small molecules as well as the change in entropy upon binding for a small host-guest system. Convergence properties of the computed entropy values as a function of simulation time are investigated and comparisons are made with entropy values from the second generation Mining Minima software. These comparisons demonstrate a deviation in {âˆ’TS} of no more than about 2 kcal/mol for all cases in which convergence has been obtained},

The time-averaged scattered intensities obtained by {DLS} were decomposed into two contributions, i.e., thermal fluctuations, {IF,} and time-independent frozen inhomogeneities, {IC.} The two variables were analyzed as a function of sampling position, where not only {IC} but also {IF} were considered to be position dependent. As often observed in gelling systems, {IC} generally dominates in comparison with {IF} irrespective of the method of cross-linking. Here, we propose a nonergodic method to examine whether position dependent fluctuations in {IF(p)} observed experimentally are due to the nature of gels or to an experimental noise. For gels with high cross-linking densities, dynamic inhomogeneities are observed as a result of the difference in the molecular environment, e.g., the difference in the local gel concentration and/or cross-linking density, resulting in the emergence of position dependence of {IF} as well as that of the homodyne diffusion coefficient, D. We will also address the importance of a third component, i.e., the low molecular weight species, {IS,} in the analysis of the dynamics of polymer gels.},

	abstract = {The ff94 force field that is commonly associated with the Amber simulation package is one of the most widely used parameter sets for biomolecular simulation. After a decade of extensive use and testing, limitations in this force field, such as over-stabilization of \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-helices, were reported by us and other researchers. This led to a number of attempts to improve these parameters, resulting in a variety of Amber force fields and significant difficulty in determining which should be used for a particular application. We show that several of these continue to suffer from inadequate balance between different secondary structure elements. In addition, the approach used in most of these studies neglected to account for the existence in Amber of two sets of backbone \${\textbackslash}phi\$/\${\textbackslash}psi\$ dihedral terms. This led to parameter sets that provide unreasonable conformational preferences for glycine. We report here an effort to improve the \${\textbackslash}phi\$/\${\textbackslash}psi\$ dihedral terms in the ff99 energy function. Dihedral term parameters are based on fitting the energies of multiple conformations of glycine and alanine tetrapeptides from high level ab initio quantum mechanical calculations. The new parameters for backbone dihedrals replace those in the existing ff99 force field. This parameter set, which we denote {ff99SB,} achieves a better balance of secondary structure elements as judged by improved distribution of backbone dihedrals for glycine and alanine with respect to {PDB} survey data. It also accomplishes improved agreement with published experimental data for conformational preferences of short alanine peptides and better accord with experimental {NMR} relaxation data of test protein systems.},

In all cases, the adsorption equilibrium capacity decreased with increasing salt. However, the adsorption kinetics was strongly influenced by the adsorbent structure and protein characteristics. For the smaller and positively charged lysozyme, the effective pore diffusivity was only weakly dependent on salt for the dextran-free media, but declined sharply with salt for the dextran-grafted materials. For this protein, the dextran grafts enhanced the adsorption kinetics at low salt, but the enhancement vanished at higher salt concentrations. For {BSA,} which was near its isoelectric point for the experimental conditions studied, the effective diffusivity was low for all materials and almost independent of salt. Finally, for the larger and positively charged {IgG,} the effective diffusivity varied with salt, reaching an apparent maximum at intermediate concentrations for both dextran-free and dextran-grafted media with the kinetics substantially enhanced by the dextran grafts for these conditions. Microscopic observations of the particles during protein adsorption at low ionic strengths showed transient patterns characterized by sharp adsorption fronts for all materials. A theory taking into account surface or adsorbed phase diffusion with electrostatic coupling of diffusion fluxes is introduced to explain the mechanism for the enhanced adsorption kinetics observed for the positively charged proteins.},

Pulse labeling involves generating nuclear polarization in the partially folded state, rapidly refolding the protein within the {NMR} sample tube, then detecting the polarization in the well dispersed native-state Spectrum. Differences in the solvent accessibility of specific side chains in the various molten globule states indicate that the hydrophobic clusters involved in stabilizing the a-lactalbumin fold can be formed from interactions between a variety of different hydrophobic residues in both native and nonnative environments. The multiple subsets of hydrophobic clusters are likely to result from the existence of distinct but closely related local minima on the free-energy landscape of the protein and show that the fold and topology of a given protein may be formed from degenerate groups of side chains.},

Because complex systems often undergo nontrivial structural transition during state switching, achieving efficient free-energy calculation can be challenging. As identified earlier, the {“Hamiltonian”} lagging, which reveals the fact that necessary structural relaxation falls behind the order parameter move, has been a primary problem for generally low free-energy simulation efficiency. Here, we propose an algorithm by achieving a random walk in both the order parameter space and its generalized force space; thereby, the order parameter move and the required conformational relaxation can be efficiently synchronized. As demonstrated in both the alchemical transition and the conformational transition, a leapfrog improvement in free-energy simulation efficiency can be obtained; for instance, () it allows us to solve a notoriously challenging problem: accurately predicting the value of a buried titratable residue, Asp-66, in the interior of the {V66E} staphylococcal nuclease mutant, and () it allows us to gain superior efficiency over the metadynamics algorithm.},

Aqueous propionamide {(CH3CH2CONH2,} or {PrAm)} solutions were also studied, because {PrArn} is an exact model for the {PAArn} constitutional repeat unit {(CRU).} The longest time scale dynamics observed for both aqueous {PAAm} and {PrAm} solutions occur in the 4-10 ps range. Over the range of concentrations from 0 to 40 wt \%, the picosecond reorientation time constants for the aqueous {PAArn} and {PrAm} solutions scale linearly with the solution concentration, despite the fact that the solution shear viscosities vary exponentially from I to 264 {cP.} For a given value of solution concentration in weight percent, constant ratios of measured reorientation time constants for {PAAm} to {PrAm} are obtained. This ratio of {PAAm} to {PrAm} reorientation time constants is equal to the ratio of the volume for the {PAAm} constitutional repeat unit {(-CH2CHCONH2-)} to the molecular volume of {PrAm.} For these reasons, we assign the polymer reorientation dynamics to motions of the entire constitutional repeat unit, not only side group motions. Simple molecular dynamics simulations of {H[-CH2-CH(CONH2)-](7)H} in a periodic box with 180 water molecules support this assignment. Amide-amide and amide-water hydrogen-bonding interactions lead to strongly oscillatory femtosecond dynamics in the Kerr transients, peaking at 80, 410, and 750 fs.},

	abstract = {Solvation free energy is an important molecular characteristic useful in drug discovery because it represents the desolvation cost of a ligand binding to a receptor. Most of the recent developments in the estimation of solvation free energy require the use of molecular mechanics and dynamics calculations. Group contribution methods have been rarely used in the past for calculating salvation free energy because automated prediction methods have not been developed in this regard. As an aid to combinatorial library design, we explored rapid and accurate means of computing salvation free energies from the covalent structures of organic molecules and compared the results on a test set with the {GB/SA} solvation model.. Two independent additive-constitutive {QSPR} methods have been developed for the computation of solvation free energy. The first is a {QSPR} model {(HLOGS)} derived using a technique that uses the counts of distinct/similar fragments and substructures for each molecule as variables in a {PLS} regression. The second method {(ALOGS)} uses an extensive atom classification scheme developed earlier for the calculation of Log P. A database of 265 molecules with experimentally determined salvation free energies is used to derive the {HLOGS} (r = 0.97; rms = 0.58) and {ALOGS} (r = 0.98; rms = 0.38) models, which were then tested on 27 molecules not present in the training set. A detailed comparison of the {HLOGS,} {ALOGS,} {GB/SA} (with {AMBER*} and {OPLSA*} potentials) on the test set showed that the {HLOGS} and {ALOGS} models give better results than the {GB/SA} model. Among the three methods tested, the {ALOGS} method gives the best result on the test set (r = 0.96; rms = 0.86), though the parametrization for this method is incomplete as many atom types are undetermined due to their absence in the current training set. The {HLOGS} method appears to handle intramolecular interactions better than the {ALOGS} method.},

Human alpha-lactalbumin {(alpha-LA)} is a two-domain Ca2+-binding protein that partially unfolds at low {pH} to form a molten globule. {NMR} spectra of molten globules are characterized by broadened resonances due to conformational fluctuations on microsecond to millisecond time scales. These species are often studied at high temperature where {NMR} resonances are observed to sharpen. The effect of higher temperatures on fast time-scale backbone dynamics of molten globules has not been investigated previously. Here, {1D} N-15 direct-detection and {2D} indirect-detection {H-1-N-15} heteronuclear {NOE} experiments have been used to probe fast time-scale dynamics at low and high temperatures for three disulfide-bond variants of human {alpha-LA} that form molten globules. Disulfide bonds are found to have a significant effect on backbone dynamics within the beta-domain of the molten globule; within the alpha-domain, dynamics are not significantly influenced by these bonds. At 20 degrees C, backbone mobility is significantly decreased in both domains of the molten globule compared to the mobility at 40-50 degrees C. Heteronuclear {NOE} values determined at 20 degrees C for the alpha-domain are closely similar to those observed for native {alpha-LA,} indicating that the {alpha-LA} molten globule has even more native-like character than suggested by studies conducted at higher temperature. Our results highlight the importance of considering the temperature dependence of the molten globule ensemble when making comparisons between experimental data obtained under different conditions.},

Replacements of the 3-hydroxyl group in residue 7 with small alkyl or alkoxy groups, which improve contacts with the methyl side chain of the ligands' {d-Ala} residue, are predicted to be the most promising to enhance binding for both ligands. The previously reported amine backbone modification as in 5 is shown to complement the hydrophobic modifications for binding monoacetylated tripeptides. In addition, replacement of the hydroxyl groups in residues 5 and 7 by fluorine is computed to have negligible impact on binding the tripeptides, though it may be pharmacologically advantageous.},

	abstract = {Many naturally occurring biopolymers (i.e., proteins, {RNA,} {DNA)} owe their unique properties to their well-defined three-dimensional structures. These attributes have inspired the design and synthesis of folded architectures with functions ranging from molecular recognition to asymmetric catalysis. Among these are synthetic oligomeric peptide ("foldamer'') mimics, which can display conformational ordering at short chain lengths. Foldamers, however, have not been explored as platforms for asymmetric catalysis. This report describes a library of synthetic helical "peptoid'' oligomers that enable enantioselective transformations at an embedded achiral catalytic center, as illustrated by the oxidative kinetic resolution of 1-phenylethanol. In an investigation aimed at elucidating key structure-function relationships, we have discovered that the enantioselectivity of the catalytic peptoids depends on the handedness of the asymmetric environment derived from the helical scaffold, the position of the catalytic center along the peptoid backbone, and the degree of conformational ordering of the peptoid scaffold. The transfer of chiral information from a folded scaffold can enable the use of a diverse assortment of embedded achiral catalytic centers, promising a generation of synthetic foldamer catalysts for enantioselective transformations that can be performed under a broad range of reaction environments.},

Thus, timely identification of drug resistant {HIV} strains and precise evaluation of the level of resistance to the different antiretroviral drugs are crucial in the management of treated patients. Phenotypic determination of antiretroviral drug resistance evaluates the ability of an {HIV} strain to replicate in the presence of drug(s). Thus, this assay (either conventional or recombinant) provides a direct estimate of drug susceptibility. However, it is relatively difficult to perform and requires dedicated facilities. Thus, its use is still restricted. Genotypic determination of drug resistance is based upon detection of specific mutations in {HIV} genes encoding target enzymes or receptors. The assay provides an indirect evidence of drug susceptibility. However, it is easy to perform and does not require dedicated facilities. Thus, it is widely utilized in clinical practice. Its major limitation concerns the complexity of results interpretation which still awaits a general consensus. {[ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR]}},

	volume = {33},
	abstract = {An extension to the configurational-bias Monte Carlo method is presented which allows for the efficient conformational sampling of the interior segments of chain molecules whose interactions include strong bonded terms (governing bond stretching, bond angle bending, and dihedral angle rotation). The ability to regrow interior segments overcomes the limitations of conventional configurational-bias methods (where the regrowth is always directed to a free chain end) and now allows for the simulation of chain systems with low concentrations of chain ends, that is, higher molecular weights, networks, or cyclic structures. As previously proposed by Dijkstra et al. {[J.} Chem. Phys. 1994, 101, 3179] for lattice polymers and by Vendruscolo {[J.} Chem. Phys. 1997, 106, 2970] for freely jointed polymers, an additional biasing (closing) probability is used that guides the bead-by-bead configurational-bias regrowth of interior segments toward its desired fixed target. However, while the previous methods are limited to chain models for which the number of random walks that lead to closure is known or which rely on simpler and less efficient geometric considerations, the algorithm presented here allows for the simulation of chain molecules using force fields of arbitrary complexity for which the closing probability is not known a priori. It is important to note that the additional biasing probability used to guide the move does not necessarily have to be the true closing probability but that a good approximation thereof is essential to improve the sampling efficiency. To this extent, we obtain an intial guess of the biasing probability from a short presimulation or an earlier simulation of a related system or simply use a uniform biasing probability. A self-adapting scheme is then used to optimize the biasing probability during the course of the simulation for the system of interest. In addition to the conformational sampling of interior segments, the new algorithm also enables efficient particle insertions and removals of cyclic molecules (of moderate length) and thereby opens the door to simulations in the grand canonical and Gibbs ensembles. Simulation results are presented for linear, branched, and cyclic alkanes using the transferable, potentials for phase equilibria {(TraPPE)} force field.},

Abstract = {Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation is a powerful tool for studying the
   equilibrium properties of matter. In complex condensed-phase systems,
   however, it is difficult to design Monte Carlo moves with high
   acceptance probabilities that also rapidly sample uncorrelated
   configurations. Here, we introduce a new class of moves based on
   nonequilibrium dynamics: Candidate configurations are generated through
   a finite-time process in which a system is actively driven out of

   distribution. The acceptance rule is similar to the Metropolis
   acceptance probability, but related to the nonequilibrium work rather
   than the instantaneous energy difference. Our method is applicable to
   sampling from both a single thermodynamic state or a mixture of
   thermodynamic states, and allows both coordinates and thermodynamic
   parameters to be driven in nonequilibrium proposals. Whereas generating
   finite-time switching trajectories incurs an additional cost, driving
   some degrees of freedom while allowing others to evolve naturally can
   lead to large enhancements in acceptance probabilities, greatly reducing
   structural correlation times. Using nonequilibrium driven processes
   vastly expands the repertoire of useful Monte Carlo proposals in
   simulations of dense solvated systems.},

	abstract = {Abstract: We study the solvation of polar molecules in water. The center of water's dipole moment is offset from its steric center. In common water models, the {Lennard-Jones} center is closer to the negatively charged oxygen than to the positively charged hydrogens. This asymmetry of water's charge sites leads to different hydration free energies of positive versus negative ions of the same size. Here, we explore these hydration effects for some hypothetical neutral solutes, and two real solutes, with molecular dynamics simulations using several different water models. We find that, like ions, polar solutes are solvated differently in water depending on the sign of the partial charges. Solutes having a large negative charge balancing diffuse positive charges are preferentially solvated relative to those having a large positive charge balancing diffuse negative charges. Asymmetries in hydration free energies can be as large as 10 kcal/mol for neutral benzene-sized solutes. These asymmetries are mainly enthalpic, arising primarily from the first solvation shell water structure. Such effects are not readily captured by implicit solvent models, which respond symmetrically with respect to charge.},

	abstract = {We report on the organization and outcome of the fourth blind test of crystal structure prediction, an international collaborative project organized to evaluate the present state in computational methods of predicting the crystal structures of small organic molecules. There were 14 research groups which took part, using a variety of methods to generate and rank the most likely crystal structures for four target systems: three single-component crystal structures and a 1:1 cocrystal. Participants were challenged to predict the crystal structures of the four systems, given only their molecular diagrams, while the recently determined but as-yet unpublished crystal structures were withheld by an independent referee. Three predictions were allowed for each system. The results demonstrate a dramatic improvement in rates of success over previous blind tests; in total, there were 13 successful predictions and, for each of the four targets, at least two groups correctly predicted the observed crystal structure. The successes include one participating group who correctly predicted all four crystal structures as their first ranked choice, albeit at a considerable computational expense. The results reflect important improvements in modelling methods and suggest that, at least for the small and fairly rigid types of molecules included in this blind test, such calculations can be constructively applied to help understand crystallization and polymorphism of organic molecules.},

It uses a simple functional form and a limited number of atom types, but incorporates both empirical and heuristic models to estimate force constants and partial atomic charges. The performance of {GAFF} in test cases is encouraging. In test I, 74 crystallographic structures were compared to {GAFF} minimized structures, with a root-mean-square displacement of 0.26 Å, which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force field (0.25 Å) and better than those of {MMFF} 94 and {CHARMm} (0.47 and 0.44 Å, respectively). In test {II,} gas phase minimizations were performed on 22 nucleic acid base pairs, and the minimized structures and intermolecular energies were compared to {MP2/6-31G*} results. The {RMS} of displacements and relative energies were 0.25 Å and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. These data are comparable to results from {Parm99/RESP} (0.16 Å and 1.18 kcal/mol, respectively), which were parameterized to these base pairs. Test {III} looked at the relative energies of 71 conformational pairs that were used in development of the Parm99 force field. The {RMS} error in relative energies (compared to experiment) is about 0.5 kcal/mol. {GAFF} can be applied to wide range of molecules in an automatic fashion, making it suitable for rational drug design and database searching. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It is observed that the {OPLS} force field yields Gibbs free energies of transfer that are in qualitative, albeit not quantitative, agreement with experimental results. Comparison of the partitioning between a helium vapor and dryer wet 1-octanol phases established that water saturation affects mostly the partitioning of polar solutes, while differences for alkane partitioning were found to be negligible. In addition, the analysis of radial distribution functions of alcohol solutes in wet 1-octanol shows preferential partitioning into water-rich regions of the microheterogeneous solvent mixture.},

In view of the resolution of the experimentally determined structures of {FKBP12} and relatively small difference of the receptor binding sites between the complexed and uncomple xed stares, it is unclear if the conformational induction mechanism is relevant to the binding of {FKBP12} with its ligands. Alternatively, we advocate a conformation selection mechanism fundamentally akin to a mechanism proposed by Burgen. This mechanism b etter explains the experimental and calculated results for the binding of {FKBP12} with {FK506.} It emphasizes that both guest and host select their most compatible preformed conformers to effect binding, and that the observed free energy of binding is a sum of the free energy change in complexation of the two most compatible conformers and the free energy changes in conversion of the Boltzmann-weighted principal conformers to the most compatible conformers. Conceptually, this mechanism represents one physica l or nonphysical path of a thermodynamic cycle that is closed by the other path represented by the conformational induction mechanism, which can also be physical or nonphysical; it provides a theoretical means to estimate the affinity of the guest to the host with the experimentally available {3D} structures of the two partners.},

We have investigated several possible approaches to extend one-step perturbation methods to also obtain accurate solvation free energies of polar species. A soft dipole reference state permits the determination of accurate relative solvation free energies for polar solutes (average unsigned error {\textless} 2.0 {kJ/mol)} but does not yield accurate absolute solvation free energies. However, contrary to expectations, simulations of a neutral reference state even yield accurate (average unsigned error {\textless} 2.9 {kJ/mol)} absolute solvation free energies for polar solutes when translational and rotational sampling of the solute is included. In general, the choice of an appropriate reference state for one-step perturbation is a challenge because of complex many-body effects.

Some comparisons are also presented for {CHARMM} 22. The tests of conformational energies consisted of two sets of comparisons to experiment and one more extensive set of comparisons to relatively high-quality nb initio data. As in the derivation of {MMFF94,} scaled {HF/6-31G*} energies and geometries were used to assess the reasonableness of the calculated intermolecular interaction energies and geometries. The comparisons for intermolecular interactions arrear to be the first broadly based comparisons to appear in the chemical literature. Taken together, the comparisons reveal that most of the force fields make sizable errors and frequently produce qualitatively incorrect results for both conformational and intermolecular-interaction energies. For example, three of the force fields produce individual errors in conformational energy of more than 10 kcal/mol, and four rate thiophene as a stronger hydrogen-bond acceptor than ammonia. Only {MMFF94} and {MMFF94s} perform consistently well. Some {MMFF} deficiencies are apparent, however, particularly for conformational energies of halocyclohexanes. These deficiencies, and others recently found for condensed-phase simulations, will need to be addressed in any future reparameterization of {MMFF.} The quantum-chemical data used in this work have been placed on the Computational Chemistry List web site. {(C)} 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

The technique allows simulation of realistic-size systems. Employing high-level ab initio data as a target for fitting allows us to avoid the problem of the lack of detailed experimental data. Using the fast and reliable quantum mechanical methods supplies robust fitting data for the resulting parameter sets. As a result, gas-phase many-body effects for dipeptides are captured within the average {RMSD} of 0.22 kcal/mol from their ab initio values, and conformational energies for the di- and tetrapeptides are reproduced within the average {RMSD} of 0.43 kcal/mol from their quantum mechanical counterparts. The latter is achieved in part because of application of a novel torsional fitting technique recently developed in our group, which has already been used to greatly improve accuracy of the peptide conformational equilibrium prediction with the {OPLS-AA} force field. Finally, we have employed the newly developed first-generation model in computing gas-phase conformations of real proteins, as well as in molecular dynamics studies of the systems. The results show that, although the overall accuracy is no better than what can be achieved with a fixed-charges model, the methodology produces robust results, permits reasonably low computational cost, and avoids other computational problems typical for polarizable force fields. It can be considered as a solid basis for building a more accurate and complete second-generation model. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem 23: 1515-1531, 2002},

	abstract = {{HIV-1} reverse transcriptase {(RT)} is a primary target for {anti-AIDS} drugs. Structures of {HIV-1} {RT,} usually determined at [{\textasciitilde}]2.5-3.0 A resolution, are important for understanding enzyme function and mechanisms of drug resistance in addition to being helpful in the design of {RT} inhibitors. Despite hundreds of attempts, it was not possible to obtain the structure of a complex of {HIV-1} {RT} with {TMC278,} a nonnucleoside {RT} inhibitor {(NNRTI)} in advanced clinical trials. A systematic and iterative protein crystal engineering approach was developed to optimize {RT} for obtaining crystals in complexes with {TMC278} and other {NNRTIs} that diffract X-rays to 1.8 A resolution. Another form of engineered {RT} was optimized to produce a high-resolution {apo-RT} crystal form, reported here at 1.85 A resolution, with a distinct {RT} conformation. Engineered {RTs} were mutagenized using a new, flexible and cost effective method called methylated overlap-extension ligation independent cloning. Our analysis suggests that reducing the solvent content, increasing lattice contacts, and stabilizing the internal low-energy conformations of {RT} are critical for the growth of crystals that diffract to high resolution. The new {RTs} enable rapid crystallization and yield high-resolution structures that are useful in designing/developing new {anti-AIDS} drugs.},

	abstract = {We show that time-correlation functions of arbitrary order for any random variable in a statistical dynamical system can be calculated as higher-order response functions of the mean history of the variable. The response is to a “control term” added as a modification to the master equation for statistical distributions. The proof of the relations is based upon a variational characterization of the generating functional of the time correlations. The same fluctuation-response relations are preserved within moment closures for the statistical dynamical system, when these are constructed via the variational {Rayleigh-Ritz} procedure. For the two-time correlations of the moment variables themselves, the fluctuation-response relation is equivalent to an {“Onsager} regression hypothesis” for the small fluctuations. For correlations of higher order, there is a further effect in addition to such linear propagation of fluctuations present instantaneously: the dynamical generation of correlations by nonlinear interaction of fluctuations. In general, we discuss some physical and mathematical aspects of the Ansatze required for an accurate calculation of the time correlations. We also comment briefly upon the computational use of these relations, which is well suited for automatic differentiation tools. An example will be given of a simple closure for turbulent energy decay, which illustrates the numerical application of the relations.},

Structural properties are in very good agreement with x-ray scattering intensities at temperatures between 0 and 77 degrees C and dynamical properties such as self-diffusion coefficient are in excellent agreement with experiment.

	abstract = {The computation of absolute binding affinities by molecular dynamics {(MD)} based free energy simulations is analyzed, and an exact method to carry out such a computation is presented. The key to obtaining converged results is the introduction of suitable, auxiliary restraints to prevent the ligand from leaving the binding site when the native ligandreceptor interactions are turned off alchemically. We describe a versatile set of restraints that (i) can be used in {MD} simulations, that (ii) restricts both the position and the orientation of the ligand, and that (iii) is defined relative to the receptor rather than relative to a fixed point in space. The free energy cost, {DeltaAr,} for this set of restraints can be evaluated analytically. Although the techniques were originally developed for the gas phase, the resulting expression is exact, since all contributions from solutesolvent interactions cancel from the final result. The value of {DeltaAr} depends only on the equilibrium values and force constants of the chosen harmonic restraint terms and, therefore, can be easily calculated. The standard state dependence of binding free energies is also investigated, and it is shown that the present approach takes this into account correctly. The analytical expression for {DeltaAr} is verified numerically by calculations on the complex formed by benzene with the {L99A} mutant of T4 lysozyme. The overall approach is illustrated by a complete binding free energy calculation for a complex based on a simplified model for tyrosine bound to {tyrosyl-tRNA-synthetase.} The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed set of restraints and confirm that the calculated binding free energy is independent of the details of the restraints. Comparisons are made with earlier formulations for the calculation of binding free energies, and certain limitations of that work are described. The relationship between {DeltaAr} and the loss of translational and rotational entropy during a binding process is analyzed.},

	abstract = {Molecular force fields have been approaching a generational transition over the past several years, moving away from well-established and well-tuned, but intrinsically limited, fixed point charge models toward more intricate and expensive polarizable models that should allow more accurate description of molecular properties. The recently introduced {AMOEBA} force field is a leading publicly available example of this next generation of theoretical model, but to date, it has only received relatively limited validation, which we address here. We show that the {AMOEBA} force field is in fact a significant improvement over fixed charge models for small molecule structural and thermodynamic observables in particular, although further fine-tuning is necessary to describe solvation free energies of drug-like small molecules, dynamical properties away from ambient conditions, and possible improvements in aromatic interactions. State of the art electronic structure calculations reveal generally very good agreement with {AMOEBA} for demanding problems such as relative conformational energies of the alanine tetrapeptide and isomers of water sulfate complexes. {AMOEBA} is shown to be especially successful on protein−ligand binding and computational X-ray crystallography where polarization and accurate electrostatics are critical.},

	abstract = {A generalized linear response {(GLR)} method was developed and applied to hydration free energy calculations. According to this method, the atomic hydration can be described as a two-step process. In the first step a point particle is introduced into water, which, according to the scaled particle theory, creates a cavity with the size of a water molecule. The free energy change of this step for the simple point charge {(SPC)} water model can be calculated as {1.49k(B)T.} In the second step the introduced point particle is transformed into a solute atom. The free energy change of this step can be calculated by the linear response approximation, which is applied to van der Waals and electrostatic interactions, as {[V-H(a)](0.5)} Here {V-H(a)} is the solute-water interaction function, and [...](0.5) denotes the ensemble average at the midpoint of the thermodynamic path between the point particle state and the hydration state. The {GLR} method was tested by the calculation of hydration free energies of several neutral organic compounds. The results of the calculation were in close agreement with the experiment and were also comparable with those obtained by the conventional free energy simulation method; the computational cost was decreased by about one order of magnitude. The {GLR} approach is more general than the existing linear response methods for free energy calculations because it applies the linear response approximation to electrostatic and van der Waals interactions and does not incorporate any empirically determined parameters. {(C)} 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

The membrane solution is viewed as an inhomogeneous, mixed solvent system, and the free energy of solvation of a solute in membrane is computed with a realistic set of potential functions by the method of energy representation. Carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, benzene, and ethylbenzene are adopted as model solutes to analyze the binding into 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine {(DMPC)} membrane. It is shown that the membrane inside is more favorable than bulk water and that the solute distribution is diffuse throughout the membrane inside. The membrane-water partition coefficient is then constructed with the help of the {Kirkwood-Buff} theory from the solvation free energy obtained separately in the hydrophobic, glycerol, headgroup, and aqueous regions. To discuss the role of repulsive and attractive interactions, the solvation free energy is partitioned into the {DMPC} and water contributions and the effect of water to stabilize the benzene and ethylbenzene solutes within the membrane is pointed out.

Here, we examine the energetics of hydrating cavities formed at protein-ligand interfaces using molecular dynamics simulations. The free energies of hydrating two cavities in the active site of two liganded complexes of cytochrome P450cam were calculated by multiconfigurational thermodynamic integration. The complex of cytochrome P450cam with 2-phenyl-imidazole contains a crystallographically well defined water molecule mediating hydrogen bonds between the protein and the inhibitor. We calculate that this water molecule is stabilized by a binding free energy of -11.6 6.6 {kJ/mol.} The complex of cytochrome P450cam with its natural substrate, camphor, contains a cavity that is empty in the crystal structure although a water molecule in it could make a hydrogen bond to camphor. Here, solvation of this cavity is calculated to be unfavorable by 15.8 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 5.0 {kJ/mol.} The molecular dynamics simulations can thus distinguish a hydrated interfacial cavity from an empty one. They also provide support for the notion that protein-ligand complexes can accommodate empty interfacial cavities and that such cavities are likely to be unless more than one bond can be made to water molecule in the cavity.},

	doi = {10.1021/jp046520o},
	abstract = {Abstract: Relative binding free energies of amino acid derivatives to the host macrobicycle 12 in chloroform are calculated to determine the effect of stereochemistry and amide bond conformation. Simulations are performed for three different amino acid derivatives using Monte Carlo simulations, free energy perturbations, and the generalized Born/surface area solvation model. The free energy results support previous experimental findings that the L enantiomers of N-acetyl phenylalanine carboxylate and N-acetyl alanine carboxylate bind preferentially over the D enantiomers and that the amide bond is in the cis conformation for the bound L enantiomers. The enantioselectivity arises because of better shape complementarity, and the cis stabilization is achieved by a selective hydrogen bond to the cavity rim of the host and a remote steric stabilization of the side-chain 1 dihedral angle. This computational approach was also applied to N-acetyl glycine carboxylate and indicated that, for this amino acid derivative, both the trans and the cis forms of the acetyl amide can be accommodated within the macrobicycle cavity. Experimental evidence to support this finding was obtained by detailed {NMR} experiments on a 1:1 complex of M12 and N-acetyl glycine. The study demonstrates two important points regarding binding and conformation: First, the destabilization of the 1 dihedral angle of N-acetyl phenylalanine away from the most stable conformation appears to stabilize the cis conformation of the preceding amide bond, suggesting that amino acids other than proline might be able to increase the likelihood of cis amide bonds. More generally, internal conformational coupling is an important factor to consider in molecular recognition. Second, the comprehensive sampling protocol undertaken for this relatively small system that allows the host to adjust properly to each guest is shown to be crucial in obtaining converged free energies and different binding modes. Subtle changes in host geometry have profound effects on binding. Conversely, different binding modes arising from small changes in guest conformation, chirality, or side chain serve as a reminder that binding modes are not always transferable between apparently similar molecules.},

By calculation of local translational and reorientational correlation functions on trajectories of individual molecules in equivalent local environments, it is possible to extract local reorientational and translational diffusion quantities. In our simulated liquid mixtures, we classify the environments of different centres like crosslinkers, side chains, pores and water regions in the complex structure. We get insight into the local molecular dynamics of water molecules from the calculation of local reorientational relaxation times and diffusion coefficients from the slope of the mean square displacements of the water molecules in the specific local environments. In addition, we calculate a distance dependent curve for the reorientational mobility of the water molecules on the {PAA/water} interface. Finally, we extract dynamical information by linking the ensemble-averaged diffusion data from the simulations to stimulated spin-echo experiments with pulsed magnetic field gradients to study time dependent local self-diffusion processes of the water solution in swollen crosslinked polyacrylamide gels.},

Abnormally high levels of {HNE} can cause degradation of healthy tissues contributing to inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, and also psoriasis and delayed wound healing. In continuation of our research on {HNE} inhibitors we have used the recently developed binding mode model for a group of cinnamic acid derivative elastase inhibitors and created bornyl (3,4,5-trihydroxy)-cinnamate. This ligand exhibited improved binding affinity predicted by means of free energy calculations. An organic synthesis scheme for the ligand was developed and its inhibitory activity was tested toward the isolated enzyme. Its {IC50} value was found to be three times lower than that of similar compounds, which is in line with the computational result showing the high potential of free energy calculations as a tool in drug development},

	abstract = {Flow birefringence of dextran solutions in dimethylsulphoxide was studied and the intrinsic optical anisotropy ([alpha]1-[alpha]2) of its chains was determined to be +12.5×10-25 cm3. The dependence of birefringence in dextran films of different thickness on the angle of incidence of polarized light was then studied and the surface birefringence of the film was determined. The dependence of surface birefringence on film thickness has made it possible to determine the effective thickness of the anisotropic near-surface layer, while the comparison of the surface birefringence with the value of ([alpha]1-[alpha]2) enabled the estimation of the orientation of the molecular fragments with respect to the film surface.},
